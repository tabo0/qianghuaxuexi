Each one of the bullet points in bold black should be 1 -2 page each. Images, graphs, and other icons should be added to those pages to add texture to the brochure. The brochure can defiate from wording in the bullet points, but the same ideas have to be relayed. Any point that is exact information such as our GSA Contract numbers needs to be exactly mentioned. The winner of this brochure design will also be highly considered for further projects with our business brochures for the government as we expand this business.","anything_else":"Please leave the design format and wording of the capabilities statement as is.
