We actually have 11 business lines that make up our full-service approach! Not every client needs all services, so we customize them according to their specific need.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many pages of print design do you need?\r\nIt should include a cover, back page, table of contents, and some varied interior layouts. We plan to use this in Adobe InDesign, although we have Illustrator as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nList the size requirement(s) for your print design\r\n8.5x11\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is your industry?\r\n Real Estate and Construction\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe the target audience for your print design\r\nOwners, developers, and investors of large-scale, commercial-grade real estate. Think shopping centers, malls, office high-rises, business complexes, industrial warehouses, etc. LandQwest does not provide residential real estate services.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat 3 things would you like to communicate to your audience through your print design?\r\nProgressive Materials\r\nCompetitive Design\r\nUniform Branding\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat print design styles do you like?\r\nWe recently introduced a new logo and website (LQWEST.com), and are currently enhancing a number of brochures that discusses the services within each division. \r\n\r\nThe overall appearance would be fresh and contemporary - not too corporate, but still professional.\r\n\r\nSome competitors have a design element that is unique to their brand, but that doesnt necessarily relate to the company name, location, etc. For example, Jones Lang LaSalle (www.us.jll.com) incorporates a paintbrush effect on numerous materials. While not a requirement, it would be very interesting to see what LandQwest could present to the market. Weve used gradient and color overlays, transparent text, waves, swoops, parallax effects and more in the past, so we are open to new ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat colors do you want to see in your print design?\r\nOrange CMYK   0 / 55 / 100 / 0\r\nBlue CMYK       100 / 76 / 0 / 38\r\nGray CMYK       0 / 0 / 0 / 40 - 60 - 80\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your print design?\r\nPlease try to use the CMYK's provided to the extent possible (or variations thereof). \r\n\r\nPlease also refrain from waves, swoops, excessive box shapes or negative/white space.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat adjectives should best describe your print design?\r\nUnique\r\nFresh\r\nFluid\r\n\r\n\r\nHow will you use the print design?\r\nPrinted Booklet & E-book\r\n\r\nThese brochures will be relatively uniform in appearance, but the content within each will be devoted to that service. The winning design will also be used for company newsletters and so forth, so were looking for just one design (think marketing brochure) that concentrates on the overall design rather than the content. Something that can ultimately identified as the LandQwest brand.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat content must be included in the print design?\r\nFor draft purposes, please use our Land Division as a pilot. Content can be found at http://lqwest.com/land-division, and use placeholders for images.\r\n\r\nOur Land Division provides acquisition, zoning, entitlement, highest and best use, cost analysis, geographic studies and so much more for land that can be used for multi-family, retail, office, industrial, agricultural, governmental purposes and so forth. The Land team could then work with the tenant representation, leasing, management, and/or disposition teams to provide a complete range of services to our clients.\r\n\r\nFor additional content, see:\r\nhttp://lqwest.com/brokerage\r\nhttp://lqwest.com/tenant-rep\r\nhttp://lqwest.com/property-management","description":null,"legacy_brief_sections":[{"questions":[{"legacy_field_id":1254297,"label":"Business Name","legacy_domid":"id_business_name","value":"LandQwest Commercial","name":"business_name"},{"legacy_field_id":1254298,"label":"What do you do?","legacy_domid":"id_what_do_you_do","value":"LandQwest Commercial is a full-service Commercial Real Estate company in Florida.
