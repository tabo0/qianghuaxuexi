They provide customized personal training for those interested in physical fitness.  It is a company concerned with health, well-being, physical fitness, nutrition, strength, speed, flexibility, and agility.\r\n\r\nHERE IS WHAT WE NEED:\r\n\r\nWe need a clean, sporty, stylish, seamless, and straight-to-the-point logo that will be used for the Website.  It will be something similar to the Nike logo swish with the Nike text (company name) below the logo icon.  It doesn't have to be an icon, we are just looking for clean text and maybe some type of graphic to go with the physical fitness aspect of the company.  In other words, if there is some way to visually represent physical fitness with some sort of icon near the logo, then, use that.  The logo should appeal to men and women interested in physical fitness, and also interested in the physical fitness of their children.  The logo should be delivered in a vector format, as well as psd, as well as any fonts used to develop the logo should also be submitted upon completion.\r\n\r\nThe logo should be a welcoming, intellectual, professional, smart, winning, trust-worthy, to the point, experienced, and humble design.  It should be traditional, not anything with crazy loud colors or weird graphics embedded into the text of the logo.  The text of the logo, and if there is any icon near the logo should be separate (unless there is some great way to seamlessly integrate the two)...either way, we are open, as long as it looks professional.\r\n\r\nOUR TARGET AUDIENCE IS:\r\n\r\nThe target audience is men and women interested in physical fitness, and also interested in the physical fitness of their children.\r\n\r\nWE LIKE THESE DESIGNS:\r\n\r\nhttp://kingsports.net/ (the logo is too busy, but, idea is good)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nypersonaltraining.com/ (logo is clean and has the entire name \"New York Personal Training\" spelled out)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.methodfitness.com/ (like the little icon next to the \"Method Fitness\" and entire method fitness text spelled out)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fitsync.com/ (the fact that one side is orange and the other is white is appealing, kind of like a color separation of words, the icon next to the logo is nice as well, also, the logo seamlessly fits in with the background)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.mobiletracker.net/archives/images/cingular-logo.jpg (love this use of logo and text)\r\n\r\nWE ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE (or we don't want to see) THIS IN OUR DESIGN:\r\n\r\nWe must have a logo that can blend in with the site colors, appeal to a broad audience of adult men and women, yet, still have some flair.  www.crowdspring.com's logo is pretty good in that it blends in well with the site design and colors, still has a type of icon next to it, and is separated into two words nicely (although we have 3 words, Physical Preparation Inc., it can still be separated nicely like crowdspring's).  \r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, the old Cingular logo is a great use of icon, logo text separation, colors, and text positioning next to the logo.  Although the Cingular colors are a bit too bright, the idea is a good direction.  If there is a way to visually create an icon like Cingular's, but, representing health and physical fitness and nutrition, that would be perfect!\r\n\r\nWe absolutely do not want stuff embedded into the text like kingsports.net, but, if we could have maybe some icon next to the logo instead of embedded into it, that would be great.","description":null,"legacy_brief_sections":[]},"brief_questions":[{"description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
