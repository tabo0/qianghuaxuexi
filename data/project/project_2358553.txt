The books will be offered in a variety of ePub formats (iPad, Nook, Google Play) as well as hard-copy, printed-on-demand books.\r\n\r\nLectures (not part of this project) are live and mostly geared toward senior citizens (assisted living facilities, nursing home, senior centers).  Planning to expand that reach once this local market is saturated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many pages of print design do you need?\r\n8 pages (one cover page for each of the first 8 books in the series).\r\n\r\n\r\nList the size requirement(s) for your print design\r\nFull book cover must meet ePub standards for a variety of formats, including those for Amazon, Apple, Google Play, and Barnes & Noble.  \r\n\r\nThumbnail version needs to be attractive and recognizable on their respective directories.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is your industry?\r\nEntertainment and Sports\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe the target audience for your print design\r\nTargeting arm-chair travelers.  Specifically, people who enjoy reading about or hearing about travel by others who have no particular plans to personally travel to these places.\r\n\r\nMost current clients are senior citizens, often with personal mobility issues (such as requiring walkers or wheelchairs).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat 3 things would you like to communicate to your audience through your print design?\r\nENTERTAINMENT: The overall good is for these to be interesting short books to read.  They are NOT authoritative tour guides, just one person's travel journals.\r\n\r\nVICARIOUS THRILLS:  Experience real adventures, which you would never do yourself: such as backpacking in a jungle in Cambodia, sleeping on a train in India, or tent camping on a safari in Africa.\r\n\r\nCULTURAL LEARNING:  During each of these travels. you will hear about the local customs and traditions; NOT about where to eat or what to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat print design styles do you like?\r\nIdeally, each cover page will have one or more graphic items.  These could be photos, such as my head shot or a photo of me on that trip (see attached files).  Or, the graphic items could be hand-drawn abstracts of iconic images, such as \"The Great Wall\" or \"Taj Mahal\".\r\n\r\nSeparate cover pages must have a \"feel\" or \"style\" which is carried from one book cover to another in this series\r\n\r\nIf an ePub format allows it, thumbnail version should be a different file than the full book cover, giving us control over its content.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat colors do you want to see in your print design?\r\nI have no experience here.  You're the experts.  Colors should be eye catching but pleasing.  If they could enhance the entertainment aspect, that would be good.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your print design?\r\nNo requirements.  Whatever will catch the eye of a potential buyer.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat adjectives should best describe your print design?\r\nIntriguing, Interesting, Eye catching, \r\n\r\n\r\nHow will you use the print design?\r\nCover pages will be included as the cover for each hard-copy or ePub book.

May also want photos.
