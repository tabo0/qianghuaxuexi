Coeliac disease is an auto immune disorder to which the only current treatment is the avoidance of wheat, rye & barley. As such, eating out can be difficult with some places offering nothing considered gluten-free. The site aims to help the people find places to eat out be it on vacation, business, or just somewhere to eat while out shopping.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have a desired website screen size?\r\nWe would like to use the 960 grid system.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many pages (maximum of 5) do you need designed?\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is your industry?\r\nRestaurant directory targeted at gluten-free dining.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe the target audience for your website design\r\nThe main target audience are coeliacs, but there are other, smaller groups that are on a gluten-free diet. Evidence suggests that there are more female coeliacs than male. The site is expected to be used worldwide although we are currently focussing attention on North America and Europe. We anticipate the main age group being ages 25-40.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat 3 things would you like to communicate to your audience through your website design\r\nModern. Friendly. Community.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is your company different from your competitors?\r\nThere are other restaurant sites out there, but we are different in that we are specifically tailored towards gluten-free dining. The emphasis for reviews is how well they cater to the needs of coeliacs.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat website design styles do you like?\r\nWe are looking for a clean, simple design. We dont want to get in the way of the primary goal of finding places to eat. It also needs to have a modern feel. We like the look and feel of the following sites as we feel they are easy to use.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.zagat.com/\r\nhttp://yumit.com/\r\nhttp://hotels.com/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat colors do you want to see in your website design?\r\nThe colours used should be complimentary and in keeping with the supplied logo.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your website design?\r\nWe would like to avoid red.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat adjectives should best describe your website design?\r\nModern, clean, professional, sleek.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat content must be included in the website design?\r\nWireframes and the logo in both jpg and eps format have been provided to for the following pages that will be required.\r\n\r\n1.\tHome page\r\n2.\tRestaurant detail page\r\n3.\tSearch results page\r\n4.\tReviews page \r\n5.\tAdd restaurant page. \r\n\r\nThe priorities for us are the home page and restaurant detail page so we will be awarding the designer based on these pages.\r\nUsability is the focus as we really need to have an engaging website. We have supplied our logo which is to be used as well as detailed wireframes. All elements in the wireframes are required to be in the design. The overall layout should mimic the wireframes, but we are open to changes where it necessary for the design.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have additional requirements or links you want to share?\r\nThe GF Menu icon shown in the search results and restaurant detail pages needs to be an icon with those words that is in keeping with the style/colour scheme of the site.\r\n\r\nFor restaurant images, we would like a default no image image created that ideally is branded for our site/color scheme.\r\n\r\nWe would like the star rating to have a style that makes them unique to our site i.e. we dont want a basic yellow star seen in so many other places.\r\n\r\nWhere the price scale is shown with $ signs, we would like something that is currency neutral if possible that shows the price scale.
