We need a logo that illustrates or relates to the field of prognostics and health management (see wikipedia entry on \"prognostics\" for more info).  Note that \"health\" relates to the health of electromechanical systems (like aircraft, automobiles, or power plants).  Human health is NOT a focus area for the field of PHM.  The PHM field focuses on failures of electromechanical systems, how to diagnose/predict these failures, and how to recover from them.  \r\n\r\nHERE IS WHAT WE NEED:\r\n\r\nWe need a logo that will be used on the website, stationery, business cards, and other publications.  \r\n\r\nOUR TARGET AUDIENCE IS:\r\n\r\nA broad range of engineering and technical professionals (electrical, chemical, mechanical, civil, and aerospace engineering; computer science; material science; economics; physics).  The audience may be from academia, industry, or government. The average member has a graduate degree in a related discipline.  \r\n\r\nWE LIKE THESE DESIGNS:\r\n\r\nTypical PHM-related logos include illustrations of electromechanical system components (e.g., mechanical components such as gears or bearings or electronic components).  The logo may have a troubleshooting/maintenance related theme.  Color scheme is equally important.  Green/red/yellow may be used to indicate system status.  Some logo designs in the past have used signal waveforms (PHM involves a lot of signal analysis).  We have not yet decided whether the words \"PHM Society\" should appear in the logo.  We would like to see samples with/without the words.  Here are links to some PHM-related logo examples (we don't necessarily like all of these logos - these are just meant as illustrations):\r\n\r\nwww.phmconf.org\r\nhttp://www.usasymposium.com/ishm/\r\nhttps://dashlink.arc.nasa.gov/\r\n\r\nGuiding principle should be \"sophisticated yet simple.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWE ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE (or we don't want to see) THIS IN OUR DESIGN:\r\n\r\nNo ECG/EKG signals.  No stethoscope.  Nothing related to human health.  No depiction of a target system (such as airplane, automobile, or smokestacks).  We prefer simplicity over too much illustrative detail.","description":null,"legacy_brief_sections":[]},"brief_questions":[{"description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
