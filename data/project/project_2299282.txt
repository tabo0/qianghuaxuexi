Advertising is one of the most effective ways to educate and change people's mind about your Cause.  Up to now, advertising has also been complex, time-consuming, and expensive for the average person. AdsForCauses makes creating and buying advertising easy!\n\nThe formal definition of the word Cause is: \"a goal or principle served with dedication and zeal\".  We think of Cause as some change you are passionate about making to society.  A Cause could be political, social, environmental, enthusiast, etc.\n\nFor example, let's say you live down the road from a nuclear power plant, and you don't think it's safe and you'd like it to be closed.  The only way to get the nuclear power plant closed is to get a huge number of people to agree with you and support the idea of closing the plant.  Only when a huge number of people call for the plant to be closed will the government and others actually seriously consider closing the plant.\n\nAdsForCauses helps people who have a Cause like wanting to close a nuclear power plant.  The activist who wants the power plant closed would come to AdsForCauses and propose and ad about closing the plant.  Then AdsForCauses takes over and:\n1. Designs several versions of the potential Ad, based on the description the activist provided\n2. Prices out several publication options.  For example, a billboard will cost $3500 and a newspaper ad will cost $1000.\n3. Gives the activist social media tools to get a whole bunch of people to crowd fund the ad.  These people will contribute towards the cost of publishing the ad\n\n\nDo you have a desired website screen size?\n1024x768\n\n\nHow many pages (maximum of 5) do you need designed?\nfive\n\n\nWhat is your industry?\nConsumer internet and eCommerce\n\n\nDescribe the target audience for your website design\nThe audience includes activists, small non-profit organizations, and anyone who has a message they want to get out to a big audience using advertising.  Basically any and all registered voters are in the audience.\n\n\nWhat 3 things would you like to communicate to your audience through your website design\n1. Advertise your cause and change the world\n2. We make advertising easy by doing all the work that's hard.  You just need to provide the idea, and send your family, friends, and other supports to your Ad Proposal landing page to help fund it\n3. Advertising is the most effective way to raise awareness for your Cause.\n\n\nHow is your company different from your competitors?\nWe are different because we're focused on advertising.  A lot of similar companies focus on just helping people raise money for their cause or creating a website for a cause.  We are focused just on marketing your cause through advertising.\n\n\nWhat website design styles do you like?\nWeb2.0.  Clean and uncluttered designs.  White or light colored website background.  Here are some websites that I like:\n\n1. www.crowdspring.com  (yes, this website has a pretty good design)\n2. Mint.com\n3. TweetAlarm.com (a very small example)\n4. Jumo.com\n\n\nWhat colors do you want to see in your website design?\nI like blue.  Ideally the main website color will be some shade of blue - perhaps a blue similar to dark sky blue. Maybe with green or orange as the accent colors.  The logo shown in the attached PDF is a placeholder logo.  The actually logo is being designed in another CrowdSpring project.\n\n\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your website design?\nI don't like backgrounds that are dark or black.\n\n\nWhat adjectives should best describe your website design?\nClean, uncluttered, web2.0, easy to use.\n\n\nWhat content must be included in the website design?\nSee attached PDF of the mockups for the 5 pages I need designed.  I can provide the actual Balsamiq files if that would be helpful to anyone.\n\nNote: I'm only asking for a design of the 5 pages shown in the attached PDF.  The actual website I'm building will have more than those 5 pages, but I just need those 5 pages designed.  I'll create the rest of the pages later on my own.\n\n\nDo you have additional requirements or links you want to share?\nUsing third party fonts, photos, etc that I will need to pay extra for is OK, as long as you stay within a very small budget.  The most I'd be willing to spend is about $150 on these.\n\nI'm very excited to get started, and I will provide a lot of feedback on each design so you will know what I like and how to improve your submissions.","legacy_brief_sections":[{"name":"Business Info","questions":[{"name":"business_name","legacy_field_id":163297,"value":"AdsForCauses, Inc","label":"Business Name","legacy_domid":"id_business_name"},{"name":"what_you_do","legacy_field_id":163298,"value":"AdsForCauses is a service that helps people create and buy advertising to raise awareness of their Cause.
