DietMinder and FitnessMinder are aimed at people who want to lose weight or keep fit, but need help staying motivated. \r\n\r\nOur value proposition is about helping customers to reach their diet and fitness goals more quickly than they could without outside help and supporting their efforts to maintain what they have achieved. The tag line for DietMinder is Keeping you on track for diet success and for FitnessMinder it's Keeping you on track for optimum fitness.  \r\n\r\nWe have a broad target audience and the web site therefore needs to have broad appeal whilst reflecting our core values: trusted, innovative, committed, open and dynamic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERE IS WHAT WE NEED:\r\n\r\nWe need a design for four web pages: the home page and three internal pages. In addition to the home page (Home) we need pages that will be used to promote subscriptions for the diet service (DietMinder), to host some of the content promoted in our newsletter (Weight Loss) and to describe the company (About Us). The descriptions in brackets relate to the tabs across the top of the page in the web site structure. To get an overview of how these four pages fit into the overall structure, take a look at the attached blueprint.\r\n\r\nWe will use our web site to communicate our value proposition, generate leads and provide health and fitness information. We will also use the site to sign up visitors to our newsletter. \r\n\r\nThe home page is very important as it will draw people into the site and therefore has to be engaging and dynamic. Above all, it needs to get people to take action, i.e. subscribe to our newsletter or sign up for a trial, the all important sales bit!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR TARGET AUDIENCE IS:\r\n\r\nThe web site is primarily aimed at affluent 25-55 year old male and female members of private health clubs, who want to lose weight and/or improve their fitness. We are talking about professionals and skilled workers who take pride in their appearance and make an effort to live a healthy lifestyle. \r\n\r\nWhether motivated by image or health, they need help staying on track to meet their goals. \r\nThey have either lost their motivation or are not getting the results they want. They dont necessarily want to spend money on a personal trainer or private nutritionist and like the discrete nature of receiving ongoing telephone-based support combined with convenient, on-demand access to trained instructors when they need it. \r\n\r\nThe secondary audience is made up of business customers that have an interest in the health and fitness of its staff, members or patients. Typical customers include employers, healthcare professionals, and private medical insurers, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWE LIKE THESE DESIGNS:\r\n\r\nTake a look at these web sites to get an idea of the type of layout, use of colour, imagery and use of white space that we like:\r\n\r\nwww.lafitness.co.uk\r\nwww.vimeo.com \r\nwww.apple.com\r\nwww.carsonified.co.uk\r\nwww.heals.co.uk\r\nwww.virgin.co.uk\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWE ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE (or we don't want to see) THIS IN OUR DESIGN:\r\n\r\nWe expect the site to reflect our corporate identity (see attached stationery) and have a clean, uncluttered look and feel throughout. We have outlined the specific requirements for individual pages below. ('Contact Us' is not listed as it has no specific requirements, but we still need a design for this page):\r\n\r\nHOME:\r\n3 pieces of content (teaser)\r\nCall to action to sign-up for newsletter\r\nCall to action to sign-up for DietMinder trial offer (free pedometer)\r\n\r\nWEIGHT LOSS:\r\n3 pieces of content (full-length version)\r\n\r\nDIETMINDER: \r\nService logo\r\nImages should focus on consumer transformation and results\r\nCall to action to sign-up for DietMinder trial offer (free pedometer)\r\n\r\nJOIN:\r\nWeb form to capture personal & payment details\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWere not keen on the use of clichd images, such as dumbbells, tape measures or weighing scales. However, if you have a novel way of treating such images wed be happy to let you change our mind!  \r\n\r\nWe'd rather focus on images that show the positive outcomes that we help clients achieve or the changes have improved their lives. Feel free to decide on an appropriate style of images, based on your interpretation and understanding of the brief.","legacy_brief_sections":[]},"brief_questions":[{"help":"","label":"Summarize your project.","answer_label":"Project Summary","name":"description","type":"textarea","validations":["required"],"description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
