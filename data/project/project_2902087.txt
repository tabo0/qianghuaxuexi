That is significantly larger than the solar panels of our competitors, but we need such a large solar panel in order to power our color touch screen.  The design needs to allow for mounting the solar panel on top of the Smart Station OR mounting the solar panel separately (detached from the Smart Station).\n\u000bThe solar panel needs to be able to rotate on its axis and orientation (angle) in order to maximum exposure to the sun.\n\nYou can find some examples of other solar-powered parking meters in the document:\n\"Sample Solar-Powered Parking Meters.PDF\"\n","audience":"Drivers who park their car in a surface lot or on a street.\n","company":"FlashParking sells an integrated suite of hardware and software-as-a-service solutions for parking operators and building owners to manage their valet, surface lot, and parking garage operations.  You can find out more on our website (www.flashparking.com) and watch a short video at www.flashparking.com/about-us/ to better understand what we do.\n\nWe are in the process of expanding our FlashPARCS product line to include a Smart Station (parking meter) that is powered by solar. Today, our Smart Stations must be plugged in to 110V to operate.  While this solution works well in a garage (where you can easily pull electricity to the Smart Station), it's not ideal for outdoor surface lots or street parking, where access to electricity is more difficult (and expensive).  \n\nThis CrowdSpring project will be awarded for the best \"visual design\" of our new Smart Station and how it incorporate a fairly large solar panel into it.  This is NOT an engineering project to figure out how it will work technically - it's a visual design exercise.  The CrownSpring project deliverable should look like the attached document \"FlashParking SmartStation Drawing.PDF\" (PDF, AutoCAD, PhotoShop, or even JPG).  The new Solar-Panel Smart Station will be made from power-coded bent aluminum (like our existing ones).  While it will have the same functionality as our existing Smart Station, we are looking for a radically new visual design - a fresh and modern look.  The new Smart Station should be sleek and beautiful.  \n","select_fonts":["no_preference"]},"brief_questions":[{"validations":["required"],"help":"","label":"Summarize your project.","name":"description","type":"textarea","answer_label":"Project Summary","description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
