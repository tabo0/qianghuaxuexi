CasePacer\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is your industry?\r\nLegal\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the top 3 things you would like to communicate through your logo?\r\nTo be clear this project is about uniting three brands. And Speed is the uniting element for all 3. \r\n\r\nESS (Express Software & Services) - A holding company that houses two smaller companies listed below. For this logo, we would like to see something all encompassing. Our thought was something global or encompassing with circles. It really needs to have a global inclusiveness of the other two brands. I think a circle is a good place to start for the icon. But it also needs to convey a sense of speed. I think all the logos need to convey a sense of speed.\r\n\r\nExpress Medical Records  (https://www.expressmr.com/) - A company that provides medical record retrieval services to attorneys needing records for their cases. Although it needs to be similar to the previous brand, it needs to be able to stand by itself. I don't think we want the global inclusiveness here, and the icon probably should be a bit different. The key here is speed. It needs to convey speed and service. \r\n\r\nCase Pacer (http://casepacer.com/) - A web based software that help attorney's manage their cases and all relevant documents, forms, etc. Again it needs to relate to the two previous brands, but still stand on it's own. The client really likes the little image on their current logo, so that might be a place to start. But don't feel limited to that as the image. Feel free to be creative. This company helps attorneys practice law more efficiently, so again the concept of speed comes into play.\r\n\r\nThe reason we are submitting these as one project is because we want them to be related as brands, and we want the designer to be the same on all 3.  We really want to communicate the idea of speed and service with the logos. We want to see modern fresh designs. Right now we have a significant business problem that all 3 brands are not linked in anyway. Also the previous logos are a bit dated looking, and they need to be replaced or at least refreshed. We are open to both scenarios. \r\n\r\nSpeed Speed Speed.  \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat logo styles do you like (image + text, image only, text only, etc.)\r\nI think we would like to have an image + text for each of the brands, but we are open to seeing what you come up with. It is really about your vision for positioning all 3 brands together in one space. \r\n\r\nHere are some examples of logos we would like you to gain inspiration from.\r\nhttp://www.jedrogersdesignstudio.com/uploads/images/Atomic-Logo-High-Performance-Coatings-Speed-Shop-Race-Day-Weaponry-Watts-Power-Cycling-Triathlon-Track-Efficiency-World-Record-Olympic-Gold-Silver-Bronze-Medal-Time-Trial-Pursuit-Sprints_image.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://www.biz-logo.com/pre-designed-17/fitness-gym-logo9.gif\r\n\r\nhttp://storage.designcrowd.com/design_img/27017/18899/18899_565847_27017_thumbnail.jpg\r\n\r\nhttps://s3.amazonaws.com/htw/dt-contest-entries/thumbs/4379/united-states-technical-support-it-logo-design.jpg\r\nhttp://seeklogo.com/images/F/Fast_Frame-logo-B95B87042F-seeklogo.com.gif\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis image is almost perfect for Express Software & Services.\r\nhttp://www.logodesignlove.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/continental-airlines-logo-saul-bass-150x150.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://files.crowdspring.com/entry/6104134.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJW6JEGSKDSNWYXSQ&Expires=1378944000&Signature=3Kd2wwr5IVonCAno5gua2UhaHSg%3D\r\n\r\nhttp://files.crowdspring.com/entry/6105914.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJW6JEGSKDSNWYXSQ&Expires=1378944000&Signature=4yOtc6UYk%2FjxOIZvMjGKidj3Jjg%3D\r\n\r\nhttp://online.wsj.com/media/japan_logo_G_20110916064232.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://0.s3.envato.com/files/36348175/Mail%20Fast%20Logo%20Preview.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have any other info or links you want to share?\r\nAlso, the client doesn't hate their current branding either, so if you can include or evolve the previous branding that will also be looked at very favorably.
