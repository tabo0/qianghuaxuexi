Through a highly rigorous and competitive process, the Marketplace will provide entrepreneurship development support, market linkages, and access to finance opportunities to the most promising and innovative ideas.\r\n\r\nThe Diaspora Marketplace will channel the diaspora community's knowledge, entrepreneurial spirit, significant risk appetite, and resources in a way that promotes overall economic development, creating local economic opportunities while reducing the vulnerability of populations to economic shocks, such as the current financial and food/fuel inflation crisis.\r\n\r\nPoint of clarification: \r\nDiaspora refers to the movement of any population sharing common ethnic identity who were either forced to leave or voluntarily left their settled territory, and became residents in areas often far removed from the country of origin.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERE IS WHAT WE NEED:\r\n\r\nWe are looking for a logo that represents the transnational identity and innovation of diaspora communities. The logo should invoke the spirit of entrepreneurship and economic growth within the context of an interconnected world.  The logo should represent their global identity and their role as development drivers. \r\n\r\nWe would like the final submissions as ai and jpegs, though additional formats are welcome.\r\n\r\nWe are bound by several U.S. government font/color restrictions (sorry!) \r\n\r\nAcceptable fonts:\r\nGill Sans - Regular, Light, Italic, Bold\r\nArial - Regular, Italic, Bold\r\n\r\nAcceptable colors:\r\n\r\nBlack\r\nWhite\r\nDark Gray (102R 102G 102B     0C 0M 0Y 70K)\r\nLight Gray ( 221R 221G 221B     0C 0M 0Y 15K)\r\nDark Blue (0R 42G 108B    100C 72M 0Y 18K)\r\nRed (194R 17G 58B    0C 100M 63Y 12K)\r\nLight Blue (51R 103G 153B    29C 12M 0Y 0K)\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR TARGET AUDIENCE IS:\r\n\r\nParticipants in the Diaspora Marketplace are mobile, diverse, and entrepreneurial migrant or diaspora communities. \r\n\r\nWE LIKE THESE DESIGNS:\r\n\r\nPlease take a look at the \"can't haves\" and the font/color constraints listed above.  Beyond that, let creativity reign!\r\n\r\nWE ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE (or we don't want to see) THIS IN OUR DESIGN:\r\n\r\nWe don't want anything that is too closely aligned with a particular ethnicity or religion.  This is an international platform, so don't use an African print that won't resonate, say, with El Salvadorans.  Likewise, I know it's tempting to use a dollar sign, but no currency icons. \r\n\r\nWe don't like cartooney graphics - simple and crisp is best. If you use 3-D or reflection/light effects, please keep them minimal and professional.  Our printing presses aren't the best, and we need a logo that looks just as good on a photocopy as on a professional brochure.","description":null,"legacy_brief_sections":[]},"brief_questions":[{"description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
