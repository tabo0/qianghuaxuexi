Her hair is held back by braids from her temples that cross behind her head.  This is all pinned by a clasp that has a raven feather in it.\n\nShe will either hold or possess on her belt a one handed metal axe that has lightning bolts along its haft.  The head of the axe glows a faint blue.  Regardless of where the axe is, she must hold a long metal staff in one hand.\n\nAs for her clothing she should wear a long robe that is similar to a tabard.  The goal is that she is wearing a long piece of clothing with openings along the sides for mobility.  She is wearing trousers underneath that and she has high boots.  There can be some creativity here.  She cannot show cleavage or a lot of leg.  Her garments are functional and used for battle and travel; they are not sexy,","book_about":"The book is about a young woman that becomes a warmage.
