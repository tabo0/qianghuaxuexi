Our demographics are very broad, so the logo and tagline need to have a general appeal. \r\n\r\nWe are likening the flow of life to the flow of trash in a very fun, insightful way. Our goal: help you get rid of the inner garbage that's been holding you back and cluttering your way. As such, we want the logo and styling of the tagline to convey positive, uplifting change.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the top 3 things you would like to communicate through your logo?\r\n- Approachable. Nothing too stuffy or formal, yet not too childlike or informal. We want to build a brand around your design, so we're straddling the line between relaxed/inviting and corporate styling.\r\n\r\n- Classy. Nothing \"cartoony\" or juvenile. We change people's lives with our books and courses, which means we need to be taken seriously. \r\n\r\n- Inspirational and Uplifting.

We also want to have stylized text for our tagline: \"Channel Your Inner Garbageman\" The latter may or may not have an exclamation point after it and it may not be the same font as the logo.

Cover of our books, course materials, website, clothing and other merchandise, and so on. The logo and tagline will usually appear together as one unit.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have other info or links you want to share?\r\nOur website isn't up yet. The first book comes out in May and this is our first step in establishing our corporate identity. Our entire brand will be built around the work you do.
