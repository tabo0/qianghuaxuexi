Our site will allow anyone to buy and sell collectible items ranging from antique chandeliers to works of art, sports cards and celebrity memorabilia\n\n\nWhat 3 things would you like to communicate to your audience through your website design\n1) The site is easy to use\n\n2) The items listed are of a high quality.

Similar to classifieds and auctions, it allows sellers to list items for sale and buyers to make offers.  However, the site does not use an auction model.  It uses a negotiation model:\n\na) Seller lists their item\nb) Interested buyers make offers\nc) Seller can accept, reject, or counter each offer.\nd) If the seller made a counter offer, the buyer can now accept, re\naccepts, rejects or make a counter offer\ne) The process continues until an offer is accepted\n\nThe attached wireframes show the content required but these are for guidance only.  The content is fixed (the designs must include each piece of content shown) but the layout is up to you.

I will consider designs with other backgrounds but I'm unlikely to accept anything with a dark color scheme.\n\nWhen adding sample photos, please keep in mind that the photos will be uploaded by users.  They will not have white backgrounds and they will not be professional grade stock photos.

I'm looking for something clean, light and uncluttered.  The point of the website is to be easy to use.  If it can do that whilst also looking good then that's a bonus, but usability will be the main factor in the design I choose.","legacy_brief_sections":[{"questions":[{"legacy_domid":"id_small_website_name","value":"SnapSale","name":"Business Name","legacy_field_id":123661,"label":"Business Name"},{"legacy_domid":"id_small_website_what_you_do","value":"classifieds and auctions of collectible items","name":"What do you do?","legacy_field_id":123662,"label":"What do you do?"},{"legacy_domid":"id_small_website_desired_screen_size","value":"1024 px wide for the canvas, but the page itself should be 960px","name":"Do you have a desired website screen size?","legacy_field_id":123663,"label":"Do you have a desired website screen size?"},{"legacy_domid":"id_small_website_pages","value":"3","name":"How many pages (maximum of 5) do you need designed?","legacy_field_id":123664,"label":"How many pages (maximum of 5) do you need designed?"}],"name":"Business Info","legacy_field_id":123660,"label":"Business Info"},{"questions":[{"legacy_domid":"id_small_website_industry","value":"Collectible items","name":"What is your industry?","legacy_field_id":123666,"label":"What is your industry?"},{"legacy_domid":"id_small_website_target_audience","value":"There is no specific demographic.
