Residence here are conservative and community-minded. They are down to earth Southerners who enjoy a cup of coffee and to get together with friends and family! \n\n\nWhat are the top 3 things you would like to communicate through your logo?\n1. Although the name of this establishment has some sexual undertones, do NOT play up on these in the LOGO..must keep it about the coffee and juices. \n2. Living a healthy lifestyle is important. We hope to keep our products as natural as possible and buy local when we can. \n3. A quaint family and friend gathering spot is what we hope for our establishment to become. We hope that people can come and cozy up with a cup of joe, or take a juice to go! We are flexible and FRIENDLY. \n\n\nWhat logo styles do you like (text only, image only, text and image, etc.)?\nThis is up to you. We certainly don't expect to be identified like the NIKE swoosh or McDonald's Golden arches. Image only should probably be avoided. However if you are able to incorporate a simple image with our shoppe name, then fantastic. If you would rather keep it text only, we are open to that too! It may help to describe the shop space to inspire you! It is very small, quaint and has a European feel. There are french doors, wood floors, and lots of black rod-iron in the outdoor seating area...as well as cobblestone. We hope the logo can fit well into this location's overall feel, however could potentially transcend into all kinds of locations should we choose to expand. \n\n\nWhat colors do you want to see in your logo?\nWe have not established a colour palette but suppose that we would like BLACK to be our primary colour. We are open to accent colours that are associated with coffee and juices, however prefer that they are deep and/or bold rather than bright.\n\n\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your logo?\nNo aversions here....lets keep it classy and simple. \n\n\nWhere will your logo be used (print, website, etc.)?\nStore sign, cup stamps, napkins, website, store memorablia (ceramic cups, t-shirts, etc.)\n\n\nDo you have other info or links you want to share?\nHave fun!","description":null,"legacy_brief_sections":[{"questions":[{"legacy_domid":"id_business_name","value":"Grind and Squeeze","label":"Business Name","legacy_field_id":121139,"name":"Business Name"},{"legacy_domid":"id_exact_name_in_logo","value":"Grind and Squeeze OR Grind & Squeeze","label":"What is the exact name you would like in your logo?","legacy_field_id":121140,"name":"What is the exact name you would like in your logo?"}],"label":"Business Info","legacy_field_id":121138,"name":"Business Info"},{"questions":[{"legacy_domid":"id_your_industry","value":"Coffeehouse and Juice Bar","label":"What is your industry?","legacy_field_id":121142,"name":"What is your industry?"},{"legacy_domid":"id_target_audience_logo","value":"Located in Charleston, SC this coffeehouse/juice bar is located at the entrance of a relatively affluent family-filled neighborhood.
