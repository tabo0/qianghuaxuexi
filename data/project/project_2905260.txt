The headlight and tail light are key features so the design should include these elements. Also, there should be a manual foot brake above the rear wheel that doubles as a fender. The wheels should be standard 8.5\" wheels (if you search amazon for 8.5\" escooter you will see some popular designs in this class for reference).","anything_else":"I expect to see photorealistic renderings of the product and receive 3d files as final delivery.

A key feature of this scooter is building a seamless phone mount/holder into the center of the handlebar so instead of an LCD diplay the user's smartphone will serve as the intelligent dashboard, providing useful information about the scooter and trip. This is a key feature so we want the phone holder to be seamlessly integrated into the scooter handlebar and have the capability to have the phone angle adjusted (near-parallell to near-perpendicular to the ground). \n\nIt is designed as a commuter vehicle so it is meant to be ridden on paved roads.
