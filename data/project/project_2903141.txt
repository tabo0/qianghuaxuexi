Specifically, we want a logo that incorporates the colors in artwork from Theo van Doesburg (see RFP for pictures and details).\n\nWe want a logo that has three triangles that are somehow connected or that share a line or two between them with smaller triangles exploding off of them, indicating movement.\n\nWe want this logo to be neutral when it comes to Christianity.
