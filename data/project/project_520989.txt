We market and sell our services to online community sites, media companies, social networks and advertisers. \r\n\r\nThe idea behind our company and our services is to help websites more actively engage their site members.   Most websites are incorporating more and more aspects of community. We provide software to help them measure and quantify user engagement in the community and tools to encourage more active user participation.  One first product is a fully customizable loyalty points programs for ad supported web sites.  Think Frequent Flyer miles you get when you use a site you really like.  The more you do, the more points you get.\r\n\r\nHERE IS WHAT WE NEED:\r\n\r\nWe need a company website for our new company. We are looking for something that is clean, professional and dynamic and will represent us in a business-to-business marketing environment.  \r\n\r\nThe designer should provide the overall look and feel of the site, including page layout and navigational elements (menus, tabs, etc., icons and buttons, pop-up dialog box design, etc.)  Where you foresee using dynamic elements such as dropdown menus or expanding accordion menus, you should demonstrate those.\r\n\r\nThe company has a logo (see attached) that is the only required design element to be included in the site design.  (The logo was sourced through Crowdspring.  His name is Raoul.  He eats points.).  Several versions are provided for your consideration.\r\n\r\nWe are kind of going for an Anti Web 2.0 look and feel.  We are a Web 2.0-like company, but are bored with the drop shadow, rounded corner look.  We kind of like whats going on over at Esty.com, clubwiki.com, threadless.com.  Not retro, not staid & traditional.  \r\n\r\nThere will be two main sections to the Website: The public website that will be publicly available at Pointomatic.com, and the customer extranet which will be password protected and only available to customers.\r\n\r\nThe main site navigation will look something like this:\r\n- Homepage*\r\n- Solutions\r\n  --- Loyalty Points Service*\r\n- Company\r\n  --- Team*\r\n  --- News\r\n  --- Contact\r\n- Blog\r\n- Extranet\r\n\r\n(* pages to be provided as comps for the selection process)\r\n\r\nActual navigation names arent as critical as the overall design and metaphor for the navigation.  We really want something fresh here.  Our decision will be based primarily on the overall look and feel of the site and on the navigational implementation.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to deliver layouts for every page, but your design must provide an intuitive navigational scheme and follow on pages should be intuitive based on your design.\r\n  \r\n\r\nOUR TARGET AUDIENCE IS:\r\n\r\nWe are a B2B company with mostly business consumers who are design conscious, web site marketing managers, web developers, user experience developers, advertising executives and buyers.\r\n\r\nThere are no specific demographic/social attributes of the target market that are relevant.\r\n\r\nWE LIKE THESE DESIGNS:\r\n\r\nOur Logo says a lot about what we like - not boxy or blocky;\r\n\r\nWE ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE (or we don't want to see) THIS IN OUR DESIGN:\r\n\r\nHeres what we do want:\r\n- A clean, open site that provides ample white space and logical areas to present information about our company and our solutions.\r\n- A creative, but logical navigation structure that provides both forward and backward navigation.\r\n- Design elements (buttons, icons, background images) that demonstrate creativity and spark.\r\n- Layouts of the Homepage, the Solutions page and the Company>Team page with 2 team members listed.\r\n\r\nAnd heres what we dont want:\r\n- Rounded corners\r\n- Folder tabs for navigation\r\n- Twitter-esque, Tumblr-esque, Web 2.0 big block color backgrounds.\r\n\r\nSize: \r\n The size should be optimized for a 1024x768 browser.  Primary/Usable space must fit to ~900-1000 pixels wide.\r\n\r\nColors:\r\nOur Logo uses the following RGB Colors.  They provided only as guidance.  Please use complementary tones.\r\no\tR:16  G: 40   B:64\r\no\tR:210   G:211   B:194\r\n\r\nFile Format:\r\n\tPSDs\r\n\r\nDesigns may incorporate JavaScript and Flash elements as appropriate, but where incorporated, the functional and design implications must be highlighted.","description":null,"legacy_brief_sections":[]},"brief_questions":[{"description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
