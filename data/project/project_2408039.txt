Encouragement - That the customer will be inspired by the time spent assembling the product (a puzzle that features a Bible verse and image based on a promise of God)     2. Hope - in the promises of God.   3.  Quality - There are several levels of quality of jigsaw puzzles on the market. Ours will be high end quality. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat logo styles do you like (image + text, image only, text only, etc.)\r\nMost likely text only. If there is a graphic element to the logo you'd have to be careful that it isn't too contrived or forced. Most imagery in the religious space is too literal. It might work if it conveys hope or optimism as opposed to a cross or an angel for example. OR...it could include a graphic that is a literal puzzle piece.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have any other info or links you want to share?\r\nThe parent company for this project is FairHope Direct. You can see our main product line, FairHope Notes, at our website at fairhopenotes.com. I've also included the parent company logo as part of this project brief.\r\n\r\nFairHope Direct is a unique business whose purpose is to help people experience Gods presence. This is primarily achieved by promoting and distributing God-honoring products and services directly to the Christian market.\r\n\r\nOur most popular program is called FairHope Notes, which offers a collection of contemporary Christian greeting cards designed to help customers send blessings of Gods love for every occasion. By producing and providing exclusive Christian products, our objective is to support people in their own ministry of encouragement and encourage a lifestyle of worship.\r\n\r\nWe are launching a line of jigsaw puzzles under the name 'FairHope Promise Puzzles'. The Bible contains many promises from God and each puzzle will reflect one of those promises...God's Help, God's Wisdom, God's Love, God's Care, etc. Each puzzle will feature a carefully chosen image paired with a specific verse from the Bible to reflect that promise. Each puzzle will also be paired with Devotional material that helps the customer understand and reflect on the subject of that particular puzzle (God's Help, God's Love, etc.) and apply it to their life.\r\n\r\nI've included a zipfile with png images of some sample puzzle products on the market so that you can be sure of the type of product I'm describing.\r\n\r\nI've also included a few samples of initial puzzle development so you can see what I mean about puzzles based on promises of God. The first puzzle is based on 'God's Help.'\r\n\r\n'FairHope Promise Puzzles' is a long name so I'm thinking the logo treatment should have the word 'FairHope' as an eyebrow (smaller type) treatment with the main read of the logo being 'Promise Puzzles'.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have questions or if you need further explanation.
