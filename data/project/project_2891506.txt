(Note: symbol will be used for ‘discovery’ branding, i.e. on boots, as well as grassroots marketing, whereas namemark will be prominent on consumer spaces, i.e. airstream, boxes, bags, digital media, and referral pieces)\n•\tIn play are symbols that feel more independent, local, accessible personality, i.e. airstream drawing; not corporate or cold\n•\tInspiration / usage of Austin lifestyle elements, as long as they are clean, approachable and easy to comprehend.  Austin elements that we connect with: our Airstream trailer, water (lake/rivers), music, food tucks, inner tubes, rafts, tacos, cocktails\n•\tOpen to explore different font treatments from current Interstate font\n•\tIn play but could be a phase 2 exploration:  symbol mark where elements of the illustration could be pulled out as individual icons for website navigation, etc. \n\nOut of play: \n•\tNO Western feeling fonts, or visual cues; NO Cowboy elements—no ropes, fences, barbed wire, cattle brands, hats, spurs\n•\tNot cartoony or whimsical\n•\tNot overtly feminine\n•\tSomething that looks to be solely outdoors-ey- must resonate with city dwellers as accessible Austin lifestyle (confident, not trying too hard, approachable)\n•\tOvertly abstract that makes people work too hard, i.e. Olive & June logo - SEE IMAGE -  Olive and June logo\n \n•\tA logo that looks too hipster or “flourished” (see men’s clothing boutique Scotch & Soda for what NOT to do).  SEE IMAGE - Scotch & Soda logo\n \n","anything_else":" OUR MISSION: \nTo make our boots synonymous with a mindset – for people who don’t want to be bogged down with the stress of materialism—they want to squeeze the most experiences out of life. \nOUR VALUES:\n•\tBring your best everyday\n•\tBe honest and open with each other and our Customers\n•\tHave FUN\n•\tGive back – ‘a rising tide raises all ships’\n•\tBe passionate and inspire others to follow their passion \nBRAND ATTITUDES\n•\tDown to earth, doesn’t take self too seriously, grounded, “Comfortable in our own skin” \n•\tQuietly confident, humble\n•\tPlayful, like to laugh; (but not sarcastic)\n•\tOptimistic, open minded, adventurous, \n•\tAppreciative, nostalgic (discovery, dusting off the old to show its glory to the masses)\nWe ARE: \n•\tPassionate \n•\tConfident\n•\tQuality/Detail oriented \n•\tHumble\n•\tFun\n•\tLoyal\n•\tLow maintenance\n•\tAdventurous\n \nWe are NOT: \n•\tFocused on ‘Stuff’, materialistic, snobby, hipster (not trying to impress)\n•\tTacky or degrading \n•\tPushy or aggressive \n•\tJudgmental\n•\tSloppy\n•\tHippy\n•\tTrying too hard\n•\tFashion “trendy”\n•\tSnobby\nAlvies boots give you: \n•\tInstant comfort (with our “Fast Break-In” fit technology)\n•\t“Don’t overthink it” design that fits in anywhere, anytime\n•\tDurable quality that outlasts other dress and casual shoes\nAlvies boots make you feel: \n•\tBad ass\n•\tLike you finally have your “look”/ signature style\n•\tConfident\n•\tSmart\nOur target: \n•\tBullseye: Men 22-35\nUrban and Suburban dwellers\nHHI minimum $60k\n•\tWomen secondary target\nTarget mindset of consumer: \nKey insight:  I’m a low maintenance person who still wants to look good.  Alvies give me timeless signature style that I want to wear EVERY DAY, and the boost of confidence that I have secretly wanted.\n•\tpeople who are comfortable in their own skin….\n•\tpeople who seize the experience more than stuff…\n•\tpeople who know that the best things in life can’t be bought…\n•\tpeople who know that an inner tube on the river with your pals with a cooler of beer beat a fancy cruise any day.\nBullseye target:  Men who\n•\twould love a signature style but aren’t into shopping or trends\n•\tinvest in smart pieces that will last, both in style and durability\n•\tare more focused on experiences than stuff\n•\tare willing to pay more for quality\n•\tcare more about character and integrity than showing off\n \nNOT our target: \n•\tHipster’ men-- People who try very hard at fashion to stand out.  We are targeting the low maintenance but style aware “everyman” looking for easy, practical, ‘don’t overthink it’ fashion. SEE IMAGE - of hipster man sitting in chair.\n\n•\tWestern lifestylers who are already in cowboy boots, or those with a dusty or sloppy look. SEE IMAGES - of shredding the stereotype and of cowboy boots sitting in the grass.\n     \nLOGOS that work with similar scope to ours:\nWe like these three as examples of word marks with symbols that are iconic and clean.  We prefer a sans serif font, but if you are really wanting to play with a serif font, we’ll entertain it! SEE IMAGES - Timberland, Converse, Lacoste logos\n\nPatagonia is flexible and can be used in an inclusive logo, modified to occasion, i.e. fishing, and on its own as solely a wordmark. SEE IMAGES - 3 images of patagonia used \n\nChanel is on the edge of abstract but is very recognizable and clean.  SEE IMAGE - of Chanel Logo\n\nExamples of logos that don’t work for us.  We think Red Bull is recognizable and strong, but for us, there will be too many production colors, and we need to be able to split up into elements (type and picture) and put them in small hard to imprint places like inside boots.  Red Wing Shoes has become more known for its symbol than its name, and we don’t like this execution where the name is on top of the symbol. SEE IMAGES: Red Wing Shoes and Red Bull logos\n   \n\n \nBrand mood board imagery- here’s a start:\nWe need to rewrap our airstream and can put a blue stripe down the middle if we want to.  \tSEE IMAGES: \nAirstream\nlights\nrustic chair\nchair lift swing\nbarn door\nkitchen \nColor Blue we like\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n                  \n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n","top_3":"•\tA combination logo of a Wordmark or Lettermark with the name ALVIES, (potentially the blue line, or a blue element that can be a strategic accent), combined with a pictorial mark (icon/symbol) that can (also) stand on its own.\n•\tFlat image, monoline logo with combo of sans serif typography plus a Pictorial or Abstract mark\n•\tLeverage negative space for clean placement in small locations, like a stamp inside the boots or on the bottom of the boots, and one that can be seen from afar (think neon light outside airstream trailer)\n•\tStrong, clean Typography that can withstand the test of time and wear; it must be clean, easy to recognize from afar, and able to live on its own in a single color.   (We already really like Interstate as a font, so would like that to be either inspiration for own font, or use it or something similar)\n•\tPictorial logo portion should also be able to live on its own in a single color/ B&W\n•\tPictorial symbol reinforces brand lifestyle of no-nonsense comfort and style; as part of the attitude of Austin lifestyle (laid back, approachable, fun); consumers should see the pictorial logo as aspirational to an attitude of the “comfortable life”.  Does not need to be a ‘see and say’ of Austin lifestyle- i.e. not looking for a telegraphic icon with drawings of taco, wave, music.\n•\tUsage of Blue accent / i.e. a blue stripe under the name.   We have a patent pending design element, that would be great to leverage in our brand logo.  It will be a blue stripe of wood built into the upper section of the boot heel.   It will not necessarily be visible when you’re wearing jeans, so it’s understated, but still a badge of quality to those in the know.  We want the blue to ideally symbolize the comfort of the boot. It will be a layer in the heel that is a special ingredient, so see what inspiration that provides you. If you need to see it, we can send you more info- but it’s highly confidential. \n•\tLogo supports a persona with a clear point of view/ attitude (see Brewdog brand for inspiration); https://www.brewdog.com/  for how they use their logo with a very strong font, and supporting colors and patterns to connect their pieces.
