Multi-color small size (<5 um) using InGaN nanowire structures have shown to provide superior efficiency of up to 60% to current OLED technology.  This next generation display technology will have high impact to mobile, projection, VR/ AR and HDTV.  Especially with decreasing size such as smart watches, OLEDs are extremely power hungry.  Superior cost efficiency is achieved by varying the nanowire diameters on a single chip in a single epitaxy step instead of using the conventional mass transfer technology which suffers from yield and throughput challenges.  NS Nanotech has developed the first realization of high efficiency amber/ red GaN-based LEDs by exploiting the Purcell effect in nanowire photonic crystal structures.  \n\nNS Nanotech’s ultraviolet (UV) nanowire technology will displace mercury lamps for water purification, sterilization and medical procedures with higher electrical efficiency, high electron-photon conversion rate, small size and greener device fabrication process.  \n","corner_style":"round","bc_size":"standard","how_logo_used":["screen_digital"],"select_fonts":["no_preference"],"bc_sides":"one_sided","logo_text":"NS","bc_orientation":"horizontal","bc_vision":"clean, high impact, differentiated","industry":"software-and-information-technology","top_3":"Disruptive, Next Generation Technology\nThe leading nanowire technology company enabling a brighter, more efficient and healthier futur\nFuturistic","vision":"Very clean, bright, high resolution, Distinctive","business_card_text":"Logo, Tagline (\"The leading nanowire technology company enabling a brighter, more efficient and healthier future\"), Name (Zetian Mi), Title (Chief Technology Officer), Phone ((555) 555-5555), Email","select_colors":[["ffcdd2","ef9a9a","e57373","ef5350","f44336","e53935","d32f2f","c62828","b71c1c"],["DCEDC8","C5E1A5","AED581","9CCC65","8BC34A","7CB342","689F38","558B2F","33691E"],["BBDEFB","90CAF9","64B5F6","42A5F5","2196F3","1E88E5","1976D2","1565C0","0D47A1"]],"logo_style":["image_text"]},"brief_questions":[{"description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
