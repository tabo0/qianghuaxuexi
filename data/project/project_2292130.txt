Each of the artworks  paintings, photos, photo illustrations and digital works  interprets a specific poem in the book.  All the art is complete and the poems are written.  Whats missing? The front and back cover of the book.  Thats where you come in!\r\n\r\nThe ideal creative for this project is an artistically minded person that can work with original works of art to create a dynamic print design... or a creative that has the vision to create his or her own original book cover design for a book of poetry and art.  Thats what I need you to bring to the table.\r\n\r\nHere is what I will bring to the table:\r\n\r\n--Feedback, feedback, feedback, and ratings, early and often, for *each* submission.  If I like something, Ill let you know and we can improve it through iterations. If I dont, Ill also let you know so you dont waste your time.\r\n\r\n--Striking visual art painted in vibrant colors for you to include  or not include  in your original book cover design.  Ill provide the artwork in very high resolution.  These paintings include a painting painted by my mother specifically for the poem called \"The History of Dying Stars\" which is the title poem of the book.  Wait until you see this red and black nebula painting that makes the sky seem like its on fire!  And you can use this as the base for your cover design... or not. \r\n\r\n--Creative direction and inspiration.  I have a vision for the cover but at the same time Ill be delighted if you think outside the box of my ideas.\r\n\r\n--Detailed technical requirements which will take the guesswork out what I need from the final work product.  Im publishing through CreateSpace and they have detailed specifications which I will provide. There will be no surprises on the technical requirements.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the award for this project, the winning creative will be given credit in the book as the designer of the cover as well as a signed version of the book when its published.  On a personal note, I would like to close by saying that this project is of a highly personal nature, with poetry and art that speaks to the extraordinary in the ordinary, the things we all feel but rarely speak of.  I hope you will help me bring this book to life by giving it a cover to remember.","legacy_brief_text":"Business Name\nOscar S. Cisneros.  I am the sole proprietor of the company.\n\n\nWhat do you do?\nMy name is Oscar S. Cisneros.  I am a technology licensing attorney for a major motion picture studio.  My other passion is poetry.  I self-published my first book of poetry while in law school.  The book for this project, The History of Dying Stars, is my second book of poetry.  I found twelve artists and worked closely with them as they created 16 different works of art that interpret poems in the book. \n\nThe History of Dying Stars will be published in full-color paperback through CreateSpace.  They are doing the interior design of the book.  I will also make the book available in eBook form through Amazon Kindle, Apple iBooks, Barnes and Noble Nook and other formats and platforms.  Technical issues permitting, I also want to offer and enhanced eBook with recordings of the poems in addition to the poetry and art. \n\n\nHow many pages of print design do you need?\nI need a design for the front cover, spine and back cover of the book. \n\n\nList the size requirement(s) for your print design\nYour early drafts and mock-ups DO NOT need to conform to these requirements.  We should think big and iterate improvements.  But the final work product MUST conform to the following requirements.\n\nThe trim size of the book will be 5.5 inches wide and 8.5 inches tall.  It will be published by CreateSpace.  I need the final front and back cover to conform to the CreateSpace requirements.  Please review the PDF in the materials titled \"CreateSpace Cover Requirements\".\n\nAs noted in the requirements PDF, the \"bleed\" of must be extended at least .125 beyond trim size. I do not know the final page numbers of the book yet so please keep in mind that the spine width will have to change in your final your design. Right now I estimate that the book will be 65 pages long but I won't know the final page count and therefore the correct trim width until later in the process. Because the book is less than 100 pages, it needs to have a blank spine as noted in the requirements document. Also, remember that CreateSpace will be adding an ISBN bar code and number to the back cover as specified in the requirements document. \n\nFinally, if I select you as the winning creative, you must print, sign, scan in PDF and provide to me signed version of the CrowdSpring Artist Agreement included in the materials. I will need your legal name and business address, including the country you live in.\n\nThe final work product should take several forms:\n\n--The front and back cover laid out in PDF format a resolution of NO LESS than 300 DPI (higher is preferable) in accordance with the CreateSpace Cover Requirements document included with the materials.\n\n--The original, unflattened PSD or TIF file with all layers and elements present so the work product can be easily edited later if necessary. \n\n--A lossless TIF file of the front cover, spine and back cover at full size in uncompressed resolution.  \n\n--A lossless TIF tile of the front cover at full size in uncompressed resolution.  \n\n--A lossless TIF tile of the front cover at full size in uncompressed resolution with a special, eye-catching tag that reads Enhanced Edition and Includes spoken word recordings of selected poems.  \n\n--Thumbnails of both versions of the front cover with the following heights: 115 pixels, 160 pixels and 500 pixels (width should be proportionate to height with a preserved aspect ratio).\n\n--A signed version of the CrowdSpring Artist Agreement (I will complete it prior to your signature).\n\n\nWhat is your industry?\nThe History of Dying Stars is a book of poetry and art written in English for consumers of poetry and art. \n\n\nDescribe the target audience for your print design\nThe target audience will be people who enjoy poetry, both in book form and in spoken word, and people who enjoy art.  While some of the poetry in the book is of a sensual nature, it is rarely direct in its expression of sexuality.  But the book is not conservative in nature either.  While it is not intended for young children, the themes of the book will appeal to people of many walks of life and ages:  Love, Loss, Fantasy, Legacy and Affirmations.  Because many of the poems are romantic in nature, the book will likely appeal to women in particular but it is not chick-lit.  Indeed, the book is written from a decidedly masculine perspective even while its romance is directed at women. \n\nI will market the book through my hometown paper (a small town in South Texas) and other media devoted to my background (Hispanic publications, magazines/newsletters for lawyers) as well as mainstream and artistically oriented news outlets and websites.  I also have a Facebook and Internet advertising strategy. \n\n\n\nWhat 3 things would you like to communicate to your audience through your print design?\nThat the book is about passion, love and legacy, written by a masculine man with no apologies for having the sensitivities of a poet.  The design should be striking, colorful and evocative.   \n\nHere are two sample poems about legacy from the book.  The artwork that interprets these poems is included with the materials of this project. \n\nThe History of Dying Stars \nBy Oscar S. Cisneros\nThey seem so still at night, fixed as they are as pinpoints blurring white against the darkness of sky.  As the eyes adjust, black becomes gray, the white light of stars bright against the haze of their origins.  We are and will be as they, the history of dying stars, light traveling from an origin long since darkened, existing only as the trail, the path, the history we made in our day.  And so, now, knowing we will one day no longer be, we should ask: when we are gone, when others look to the light we made in our day, what path, what trail, what life will we show?  What will light will we shine for them?\n\nOne Candle Lights Another \nBy Oscar S. Cisneros\nPinpoints of brightness, starlight pointillism, painting endless black night with little lasting lights that flicker at wind's will yet each of them burns white light searing sincerity, too hot to hold, too cold to stand alone.  And so it goes, one candle lights another and another lights another and another lights another until the first spark fades to smoke and darkness living only in the pinpoints that follow.  Together they glow more brightly in the night.  Apart they snuff quickly in the breeze.  Little lasting lights light up lives sparked by the burning of love and kindness uncalled for.\n\nI close my eyes and I can see them, pinpoints of brightness, like starlight pointillism, painting endless black night.  I close my eyes and I can feel them, in a friend's touch, in a lover's kiss, in a hand offered to a stranger.  A landscape of little lights, sparked one by one, one from one, starting with only one, this one, this little lasting light I offer to you, the light you give to others, that one day, some day, even when we're gone, we may look out and see our little lasting lights burning brightly together in the night.\n\n\nWhat print design styles do you like?\nWhile I have designs that I admire, I do not wish to link to any because the most important aspect of this project is that the cover design must be a wholly original design created specifically for this book.\n\n\nWhat colors do you want to see in your print design?\nIncluded in the materials of this project is a photographic portrait of me.  I really like the color palette of the portrait: Black, Red and Fire.  \n\n\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your print design?\nPastels, pink and other colors that are too soft or not masculine.\n\n\nWhat adjectives should best describe your print design?\nBold, passionate, evocative, striking, masculine.\n\n\nHow will you use the print design?\nThe front cover, spine and back cover will be used for a 5.5 inch by 8.5 inch full color paperback book.   \n\nThe front cover will also be used to advertise the paperback and eBook editions of the book on Amazon.com, on my CreateSpace eStore and in various other eBook stores such as the Kindle, iBook and Nook stores.   To give you an idea of the size variations, a look at a few book titles on Amazon.com shows the front cover images being displayed in the following approximate sizes:  115 x 115 pixels, 160 x 160 pixels and 500 x 500 pixels.  CreateSpace recommends a front cover thumbnail of 130 pixels wide and 160 pixels tall.  Book cover thumbnails for the Kindle bookstore and iBook bookstore on the iPhone are even smaller.  \n\nWhile it may be impossible to create the perfect design for all of these sizes, please keep this challenge in mind in your designs. \n\n\n\nWhat content must be included in the print design?\nREQUIRED ELEMENTS FOR FRONT COVER: \n\nThe front cover must include the title of the book (The History of Dying Stars) and subtitle of the book (A Book of Poetry and Art) and it must state that the book is By Oscar S. Cisneros.  \n\nAdditionally, I will need a special version of the front cover created for the enhanced eBook version of the book.  This special version of the front cover should include a special, eye-catching tag that includes the following phrases: Enhanced eBook and Includes spoken word recordings of selected poems.  \n\nThe placement and arrangement of these required elements for the front cover is up to you.  However, the title will ideally be legible if the front cover design is reduced to a small thumbnail (as it might appear in the Kindle and iBook book stores, for example).\n\nREQUIRED ELEMENTS FOR BACK COVER: \nIncluded in the materials of this project is a photographic portrait of me.  That photo *must* appear on the back cover together with the following text:  The History of Dying Stars centers readers in the present by bringing legacy into focus: as starlight is light traveling from an origin long-since darkened, so will today's act of kindness live on tomorrow.  But the book dwells upon the future only long enough to remind us of that each moment, this moment, should be lived mindful that tomorrow is not a promise.  Love, loss, legacy, fantasy and affirmations are among the many themes of the poems in The History of Dying Stars and in each of them the author strives to find the extraordinary in the ordinary and to express what we so often feel but rarely speak of.  The book features the poetry of Oscar S. Cisneros and sixteen works of art by twelve different artists specifically commissioned to visually interpret his poetry.\n\nThe placement and arrangement of these required elements  including the size of the image  is up to you, but the text must be legible in the printed full-size edition (5.5 by 8.5 inches).\n\nSUGGESTED DESIGN:\nIncluded in the materials of this project is a painting called The History Of Dying Stars (the one that looks like a red nebula).  The painting closely matches the color palette of the portrait photo.  I really like the color palette of the portrait: Black, Red and Fire.  The suggested design will wrap the painting called The History Of Dying Stars around the front and back cover and use the color palette of the painting and the photo for the textual and other graphical elements.  The required elements listed above must, of course, be included.  This is only a suggestion but I like the concept and, because the painting shares the name of the book, I would prefer to use that painting on the cover.  Feel free to edit and tinker with the painting (cropping, close ups, etc.) in your design. \n\nOTHER DESIGNS:\nIncluded in the materials of this project is a painting called One Candle Lights Another (the one that features a candle being lit).  That painting will be included in the interior of the book but its quite appealing and, although I like my suggested design, you are free to experiment with a book cover that includes that painting and the required front and back cover elements above. \n\nAnd if you have another idea that does not include either of these paintings, feel free to suggest it!  All designs must include the required elements but other than that my only requirement is that every design element you use must be wholly original to you.  For legal reasons I cannot include and for and creative reasons I do not *want* to include clip art, stock photos or art created for another purpose.  You work for this project *must* be wholly original.","legacy_brief_sections":[{"label":"Business Info","legacy_field_id":105873,"questions":[{"value":"Oscar S. Cisneros.

This special version of the front cover should include a special, eye-catching tag that includes the following phrases: Enhanced eBook and Includes spoken word recordings of selected poems.  \n\nThe placement and arrangement of these required elements for the front cover is up to you.  However, the title will ideally be legible if the front cover design is reduced to a small thumbnail (as it might appear in the Kindle and iBook book stores, for example).\n\nREQUIRED ELEMENTS FOR BACK COVER: \nIncluded in the materials of this project is a photographic portrait of me.  That photo *must* appear on the back cover together with the following text:  The History of Dying Stars centers readers in the present by bringing legacy into focus: as starlight is light traveling from an origin long-since darkened, so will today's act of kindness live on tomorrow.  But the book dwells upon the future only long enough to remind us of that each moment, this moment, should be lived mindful that tomorrow is not a promise.  Love, loss, legacy, fantasy and affirmations are among the many themes of the poems in The History of Dying Stars and in each of them the author strives to find the extraordinary in the ordinary and to express what we so often feel but rarely speak of.  The book features the poetry of Oscar S. Cisneros and sixteen works of art by twelve different artists specifically commissioned to visually interpret his poetry.\n\nThe placement and arrangement of these required elements  including the size of the image  is up to you, but the text must be legible in the printed full-size edition (5.5 by 8.5 inches).\n\nSUGGESTED DESIGN:\nIncluded in the materials of this project is a painting called The History Of Dying Stars (the one that looks like a red nebula).  The painting closely matches the color palette of the portrait photo.  I really like the color palette of the portrait: Black, Red and Fire.  The suggested design will wrap the painting called The History Of Dying Stars around the front and back cover and use the color palette of the painting and the photo for the textual and other graphical elements.  The required elements listed above must, of course, be included.  This is only a suggestion but I like the concept and, because the painting shares the name of the book, I would prefer to use that painting on the cover.  Feel free to edit and tinker with the painting (cropping, close ups, etc.) in your design. \n\nOTHER DESIGNS:\nIncluded in the materials of this project is a painting called One Candle Lights Another (the one that features a candle being lit).  That painting will be included in the interior of the book but its quite appealing and, although I like my suggested design, you are free to experiment with a book cover that includes that painting and the required front and back cover elements above. \n\nAnd if you have another idea that does not include either of these paintings, feel free to suggest it!  All designs must include the required elements but other than that my only requirement is that every design element you use must be wholly original to you.  For legal reasons I cannot include and for and creative reasons I do not *want* to include clip art, stock photos or art created for another purpose.  You work for this project *must* be wholly original.","label":"What content must be included in the print design?","legacy_field_id":105888,"legacy_domid":"id_print_design_content","name":"What content must be included in the print design?"}],"name":"Style and Concept"}]},"brief_questions":[{"help":"","label":"Summarize your project.","answer_label":"Project Summary","name":"description","type":"textarea","validations":["required"],"description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
