Classic beautiful Moroccan/Amazigh woman (whether photo real or abstract), that reflects the vibrant Moroccan lifestyle, through using the Moroccan color palette in an elegant simple way.  Typography (product name) that’s clean and contemporary, but we’re open to designer suggestions depending upon the style of the logo image. \n\n2. Create color logo. Must also work as greyscale or black/white on solid background or when reversed out. \nWe may be using various color backgrounds on the label to differentiate product categories.\n\n3. We envision using the head, face, profile, etc. of an authentic Amazigh (Berber) Moroccan women wearing the iconic head-dress. Don’t want her image glitzy or overdone. Should reflect everyday lifestyle with beautiful, flawless skin.\n\n\nLike:  Elegant, simple, authentic, original.  Moroccan colors are very vibrant. We like that, but they can easily become overwhelming. Use color elements as a statement without being busy.  The ideal logo will create an iconic woman's image (face, profile, abstract, etc.) with traditional head dress using color with purpose and as puncuation.\nDon't Like:  Overly complicated and busy.  The logo design must work with and without the type, and in greyscale/black or white.  Think that a contemporary font against the image might be interesting.\n\nOur logo should reflect the authenticity of this coveted, beauty oil which remains handcrafted, and in limited supply. A contemporary appeal or twist for millennial customers who recognize and buy quality, high-end beauty products.","how_logo_used":["other","print","screen_digital","clothing","outdoor","signage"],"logo_text":"Biougra Argan Cosmetics","industry":"cosmetics-beauty","company":"The Biougra Argan Cosmetic Company is a small family run business that produces the highest quality argan cosmetics, made in the traditional handmade way it's been done for centuries. We live and work in a small village in Morocco and strive to reflect the beauty (both inside and out) of the Moroccan/Amazigh women in all of our argan products. Argan grows in only one part of the world in Southwestern Morocco and the bordering parts of Algeria. This authentic beauty oil has been used for centuries by Moroccan people and is now becoming known around the world. Despite world demand, argan oil is still hand harvested and made mainly by Moroccan/Amazigh women.  \n\nWomen of all ages, particularly millenial women who search for and demand the highest quality, natural ingredients in their skin care and beauty products. \n\n","anything_else":"The logo will be used for all manner of branding. Need all elements as an Ai file for final graphic (and name of font.)  \n\nI'm attaching some images. Designer must be sure not to infringe on any photo copyrights. Logo must not be identifiable as any particular woman in a photo, but identifiable as Moroccan/Amazigh. \n1. RE: rough sketch. Can enhance, change or create your own. We really like the direction, but would change three things. It is not refined enough for our needs,  we would incorporate the traditional dangling side pieces of the headdress, and she should look happier or more pleasant.\n2. Moroccan/Amazigh (Berber) woman - our favorite look of a youthful woman.\n3. Argan nut (which our argan oil is pressed from)\n4. 2nd Moroccan/Amazigh (Berber) woman. We like this too, not too overdone, but perhaps not as soft and natural as image #1.)\n5. Shape of Morocco (just in case someone can think of a creative way to work it into the design. (idea only , but not necessary).\n6. There are many types of headdress styles from cloth to bejeweled metal. Any style is okay but importance in the dangling ornaments on each side (almost resemble dangling earrings.)\nIDEA: Would be interested to know if designer has ideas on how logo can be used over a variety of colorful labels, (resembling the vibrant Moroccan palette.)\n","select_fonts":["no_preference"],"logo_style":["image_text"],"top_3":"1. Exceptional quality -the best natural ingredients the earth has to offer. NOTE: our product name \"Biougra Argan Cosmetics\" we suggest calling out in some fashion, \"BIOugra Argan\" (because in French, which is spoken in Morocco, \"Bio\" means \"organic.\" (a big plus for our name.)\n\n2. Classic Moroccan/Amazigh beauty with the vibrancy of the Moroccan lifestyle using the Moroccan color palette in an elegant simple way.\n \n3. Original - A handmade centuries old product that trancends and relates to contemporary millennial women. \n\n4. High end, expensive. Appeals to those who recognize and buy quality. (Avoid gawdy or out dated high-end designs that replicate each other.)\n"},"brief_questions":[{"description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
