You read that right: we started with \"green screens\" and room-sized computers with 128 kb of memory!\r\n\r\nWe work in the ERP segment, and our main product has been our own package, written in COBOL. Over the last 5 years we have also developed a lot of software in Java, running on Linux and Windows, and we have become experts in interfacing old dinosaurs... ahem, \"legacy systems\", with modern systems.\r\n\r\nOver the last couple of years we have looked with increasing interest at open source ERP systems, such as Compiere and OfBiz. We are now getting ready for our company's next 30 years, by investing heavily in open source ERP systems. \r\n\r\nOn the basis of our experience across legacy and modern systems, we aim to bring to our customers solutions that are as reliable as legacy, but as easy to use and cost-effective as modern systems.\r\n\r\nHERE IS WHAT WE NEED:\r\n\r\nFor the time being we need a logo, and stationery to go with it. We will then move on to a website design, but we believe that the logo is the key element in communicating our company's identity, and therefore we want to focus on it first.\r\n\r\nOur product is a critical component of our clients' businesses - if its ERP system goes down, a company cannot take, fill or ship orders, send invoices, pay suppliers, etc. Therefore our logo must reflect our principles of competency and reliability, which are the two pillars that have kept us in business for several decades.\r\n\r\nOUR TARGET AUDIENCE IS:\r\n\r\nSmall and medium companies, mostly in the United States, looking for a new ERP system to run their business. These could be companies that have so far used QuickBooks but have outgrown it, or companies that have an older ERP system and want to upgrade to a new one. In either case, these are probably companies that have heard about open source software.\r\n\r\nWE LIKE THESE DESIGNS:\r\n\r\nWe won't bore you with the usual IBM and Xerox logos. However we think it is appropriate to mention that I like the Altimeter Group's logo (http://www.altimetergroup.com/ - created here at crowdSPRING!). Simple, elegant, yet fresh. Mostly type, with a simple graphic element. Very sparse use of color.\r\n\r\nWE ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE (or we don't want to see) THIS IN OUR DESIGN:\r\n\r\nWe want to be as open-minded as possible, so there's nothing that is a complete no-no. However we are committed to giving quick feedback on the ideas we see so that you know what we like or dislike."},"brief_questions":[{"label":"Summarize your project.","name":"description","type":"textarea","help":"","validations":["required"],"description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
