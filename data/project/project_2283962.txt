We value our client's technology investments and strengthen relationships by providing the best support services in the industry.\r\n\r\nWe believe in best practices and quality work.  All of our clients are offered money back guarantees if theyre not satisfied with our services.\r\n\r\nWhile diverse in our product offerings, our core competencies are technology implementations (phone systems, network security appliances, servers, workstations, enterprise software), help desk services, and database system integrations.\r\n\r\nThe main challenge we face (as our competitors do) is balancing the need to maintain a local profile and expanding the business geographically.  We would like to eventually seed and open regional offices and provide localized services behind a national brand. \r\n\r\n\r\nHERE IS WHAT WE NEED:\r\n\r\nWe've outgrown our current look, and would like to update our logo with something simple, yet strong.\r\n\r\nIn addition to designing a new logo, we also need new business cards & letterhead for product & sales sheets.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that our future plans are to have this logo placed on:\r\n\r\n-\tWebsites\r\n-\tShirts (dress & polo)\r\n-\tPrinted sales pamphlets\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR TARGET AUDIENCE IS:\r\n\r\nWeve found that generally our audience is baby-boomers who have either worked their way into management, or started their own business. \r\n\r\nWe want our audience to look at our business and think: a) professionalism, b) trustworthiness, c) easy to work with (aka: not geeky or unreliable like some of our competition).\r\n\r\n\r\nWE LIKE THESE EXAMPLES:\r\n\r\nNothing comes to mind.\r\n\r\nWE ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE THIS IN OUR PIECE:\r\n\r\nCompany name: Trendworks\r\nPlease use red in the logo.\r\nWe found with our current logo, we have a little triangle between Trendworks and people read it as two words.  Since our name is only one word, please keep it together.","description":null,"legacy_brief_sections":[]},"brief_questions":[{"validations":["required"],"label":"Summarize your project.","answer_label":"Project Summary","type":"textarea","help":"","description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
