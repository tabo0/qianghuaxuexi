Our air travel app is the first step in achieving our goal. Business travelers & frequent fliers are our ideal target audience. Typically fliers are in a hurry, stressed out, and frustrated. The design of the app should make those problems and feelings better, not worse by being easy to use.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is your industry?\r\nSoftware and InfoTech\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat 3 things do you want to communicate to your audience through your app?\r\n1. Simplify the process of gathering travel information by making it easily available to passengers.\r\n2. The Airport Life app can be trusted by passengers to help them because it was created by a 24 year veteran airline Captain (Captain Dan).\r\n3. Replace a lot of other travel apps with a more convenient, multi-function app-Airport Life.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many app screens do you need designed?\r\nMultiple app screens would benefit from better design and a more cohesive look. The screens include: Splash screen (Better design. Leave space for future addition of logo & name of companies or advertisers that sign up with us), Home screen (Very close to desired look. Add third button on bottom row in center without increasing row height labeled: Travel Deal$), Where's My Car (Redesign 1st screen & the layout of the Personal/Rental Car screen), Airline Info/Rules/Policies (Better presentation of text rules. Better design of top window of airline page), Airport Info (Better design of top window.Add \"Ground Transportation\" button), Airport Wall (Add explaination that wall is a social networking feature allowing passengers to interact when in an airport. Better design/presentation of comments & responses to comments), Expense Tracker (Better design of entire feature & its functionality). Improve design of all of the following screens: About Us, 1st Class Upgrade features list, User Registration screen, Contact Us, Travel Tools menu, General Info, Reviews.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo your app designs need to be a particular size?\r\nThe designs must work on many different smartphone & tablet screen sizes. Design screens for both. The screens on tablets should take advantage of all the extra room available.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat mobile app styles do you like?\r\nClean, simple, easy.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat colors do you want to see in your mobile app design?\r\nUse the same blue-gray business style colors already in the app. Subtle shading and use of horizontal color gradient enhances the look greatly.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your mobile app design?\r\nStay away from black and/or dark colors.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat adjectives should best describe your app design?\r\nSerious, business-like, easy to use, high perceived value, clean, simple.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have additional info or links you'd like to share?\r\nGet the Airport Life app, register, subscribe & use the app numerous times before beginning this re-design project. Use the knowledge gained doing this to improve your design direction. Overall: The current Home Screen design is very close to my desired look, don't deviate much from it. App background screen: Use the blue airport scene as the background for most screens. Adjust darkness if appropriate. Audience: Take into consideration that users will be passengers all over the world. Use AIGA transportation icons liberally throughout app along with universal graphics to enhance usability by non-english speakers. iOS & Android versions: Same design for both unless usability is greatly enhanced by a different design element in the Android design.","description":"Our Airport Life app is off to a great start so now I want to improve the look & design of various screens in the app. I would like the design to be similar for both the iOS and Android versions of the app.","legacy_brief_sections":[{"questions":[{"legacy_field_id":615135,"label":"Business Name","legacy_domid":"id_business_name","value":"Airport Life Inc","name":"business_name"},{"legacy_field_id":615136,"label":"What do you do?","legacy_domid":"id_what_you_do","value":"The mission of Airport Life is to make flying easier and less frustrating for airline passengers (something that is sorely needed).
