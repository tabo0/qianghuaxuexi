I want the audience to look at the cover and know that the music is (a) original, (b) from Wisconsin, and (c) has a positive message.  I am totally okay with the Wisconsin association not being present on the album cover.\n\n\nWhat print design styles do you like?\nI don't have any limitations.  The original design of our CD was done in 1991 and had very limited art.  I wasn't pleased with the artwork, but we released the CD anyway.  The current cover has a picture of JHS school kids and the name of the album.  \n\nThe album is pattered after \"Free to Be: You an Me\" (http://tinyurl.com/6hvkwwa) -- in that it is all original music written by students from the state of Wisconsin, with stories between the songs.\n\nFrom a design perspective: we went with a photo at the last minute in 1991.  But I would prefer that we move forward with artwork this time, and not with photographs, as these \"kids\" are no longer kids.\n \nThe CD is all original music from junior high, middle school, and high school students in the state of Wisconsin.  The music and/or stories were written and/ore distributed in the the year 1992.  \n\nI am looking for something the would appeal to tweens and teens -- possibly by the school that the composer was associated with -- even before they hear the song.\n\n\nWhat colors do you want to see in your print design?\nThe primary color used in the original design was close to #D33B3B.  Not a requirement, just a notation.\n\n\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your print design?\nNo limitations\n\n\nWhat adjectives should best describe your print design?\nEnergetic\nVibrant\nEngaging\n\n\nHow will you use the print design?\nCD Cover Art & Liner Notes\n\n\nWhat content must be included in the print design?\nI have liner notes that include all the lyrics and authors to all of the songs.
