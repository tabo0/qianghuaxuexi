The group meets once per month for a \"roundtable\" style meeting, where we discuss industry insights, trends, and off-market listings that may be fits for our clientele. We share information with one another for the benefit of our clients. Collectively we produce nearly a billion dollars of real estate sales each year. It's a small, yet potent group of individuals. \r\n\r\n\r\nHow many pages of print design do you need?\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nList the size requirement(s) for your print design\r\n1/2 PAGE HORIZONTAL 9.5 width x 5.625 height\r\nOR\r\n1/2 PAGE VERTICAL 4.625 width x 11.5\" height\r\n*the magazine we are advertising in can accommodate either of these sizes\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is your industry?\r\n Real Estate and Construction\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe the target audience for your print design\r\nHigh end, luxury clientele in the Bay Area of California that shop for homes priced above the $1.5M mark. People that appreciate agents that have inside knowledge. Sex/gender is not important, demographics are typically people aged 30-65, household income of minimum $200K per year, values expertise and financial advice. Interests are luxury goods, wine, artisan goods, technology.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat 3 things would you like to communicate to your audience through your print design?\r\n1) The benefit of using an agent that is part of a roundtable group like this\r\n2) The group of agents in the SF Insiders are an extremely potent group of individuals with inside knowledge\r\n3) The expertise of the agents within the SF Insiders is unparalleled\r\n\r\n*(use your own words though!)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat print design styles do you like?\r\nSimple ads with plenty of white space. Apple ads are nice, Absolute vodka ads are clever and catchy.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat colors do you want to see in your print design?\r\nAny. We are looking for guidance on that.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your print design?\r\nAgain, we are looking for options and guidance on that.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat adjectives should best describe your print design?\r\nProbably a more modern look, again, back to the Apple ads. We want to stay away from traditional or stodgy looking ads with cursive/script style text et cetera. Clean, modern lines and white space are important.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow will you use the print design?\r\nThe ad will go in a magazine and be run multiple times. The magazine is called SF Magazine (https://modernluxury.com/san-francisco)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat content must be included in the print design?\r\n*We desperately need a simple logo and company colors. Our ad artwork is due on July 5th, 2017. We've added and AWARD because of the additional work.\r\n\r\nI've uploaded two versions of a group photo of the agents. That will need to go in the ad - your choice on the BW or the color version. \r\n\r\nEach agent shall be named underneath the photo from left to right, I've attached a word doc with that info. A mock-up slogan is also in the Word doc. Please play with the wording on that as well.\r\n\r\nI've also attached a silly mock-up logo that I made on Canva. It's just a placeholder but will give you an idea of what we are going for. Be creative though! We want to see much better ideas than this.\r\n\r\nAll the elements need to go on a page that matches the parameters above in order to fit nicely into the magazine.","legacy_brief_sections":[{"questions":[{"legacy_domid":"id_business_name","value":"SF Insiders","name":"business_name","legacy_field_id":1258363,"label":"Business Name"},{"legacy_domid":"id_what_do_you_do","value":"We are a group of real estate agents from different firms in San Francisco, California.
