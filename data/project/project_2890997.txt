Some ideas are to use a more industrial looking stool.    Making it look like a strong foundation to a building that has unlimited growth/improvement potential. The infinity symbol could represent the unlimited potential.   Perhaps a metal stool, concrete something more permanent and corporate.  \n\nHere is one idea.  We could write the three legs on the triangle and have a hand holding the stool with the company name under (or on) the hand and the infinity symbol on top.   \n\n \nHere is another idea.  Inside the circle you could put our initials “SSC” or spell out the name around the stool in a U shape.  We could either have something on top of the stool representing a growing or continually improving organization with an infinity symbol at the top (or on the roof) or the symbol on the top of the stool as we do now.  \n \n\n","logo_text":"Sustainable Solutions Consulting","industry":"consulting-and-professional-services","social_networks":["facebook","linkedin","twitter"]},"brief_questions":[{"description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
