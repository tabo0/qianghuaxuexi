These icons are illustrated on the Home page - see attached file. The icons you see on the screen-shot, are temporary stock icons. We need to replace them with original ones, developed specially for our site.\r\n\r\nAlso, we need eight icons for communities. The current examples are also placeholders  your designs do not need to follow the same theme. We need icons that depict the community name and theme that are easily associated with each community.\r\n\r\nThe Innovation community is the community related to product/service innovation, product/service design, research and development.\r\n\r\nThe Engagement community is the community related to customer engagement, customer feedback and brainstorming.\r\n\r\nThe Creative community is the community related to interests such as photography, video, graphic design, SW development and branding.\r\n\r\nThe Social community is the community related to social and environmental subjects such as community based projects, social production, group organizing, green issues, medicine, education, government and politics, and religion.\r\n\r\nThe Knowledge community is the community related to open Q&A, community based knowledge development, market intelligence and for collaborative sharing of ideas.\r\n\r\nThe Prediction community is related to trend watching and forecasting.\r\n\r\nThe Crowdfunding community is related to applications that involve raising money, which could be donations for good causes or investment for social or commercial projects.\r\n\r\nThe Tools community relates to software platforms that can be used to build and interact with communities for any of the previously mentioned applications in the other communities.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nOUR TARGET AUDIENCE IS:\r\n\r\nWeb 2.0 experts and social/media professionals.\r\n\r\nWE LIKE THESE DESIGNS:\r\n\r\nYou can look at live example of 1-2-3 concept here: www.leadvine.com\r\n\r\nwww.JiveSoftware.com (see attached file)\r\n\r\nwww.Pixel-Mixer.com (see attached file)\r\n\r\nWE ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE (or we don't want to see) THIS IN OUR DESIGN:\r\n\r\nWe can provide you with mock-ups of Home and Communities pages (*.psd) if needed.\r\n\r\n\tIcons that you create, should meet the requirements:\r\n\tHome page: not wider than 200 px;\r\n\tCommunities page: 100100 px;\r\n\tAll icons should be provided in source files  (PSD, AI/EPS or layered PNG/TIFF are appreciated);\r\n\tAll colors  in RGB.","legacy_brief_sections":[],"description":null},"brief_questions":[{"description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
