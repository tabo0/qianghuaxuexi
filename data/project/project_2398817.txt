We hope to start and/or acquire other types of businesses in the future as well.\r\n\r\nScion Construction is an underground utility contractor that specializes in horizontal directional drilling and trenching to install new underground facilities such as water, sewer, power, gas, and telecommunication lines.\r\n\r\nScion Transport is a trucking and hauling company.\r\n\r\nScion Development is a small real estate development and management that currently own several residential rental properties and will soon begin acquiring commercial properties as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the exact name you would like in your logo?\r\nScion Group, Scion Construction, Scion Transport, Scion Development\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat specific designs do you need?\r\n[u'Business cards', u'Letterhead', u'Envelopes']\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is your industry?\r\n Real Estate and Construction\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe the target audience for your logo and stationery\r\nThe main purpose of the logo will be to unify and create a brand for all of the companies. It will be used on our websites, business cards, letterhead and to brand the vehicles and equipment for Scion Construction and Scion Transport. For these two companies the audience will primarily be other contractors, municipalities, engineers, etc. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat 3 things would you like to communicate to your audience through your logo and stationery?\r\nFor a construction company, we are pretty creative, outside the box thinkers. we like to think of ourselves as solution providers. The logo should communicate strength, integrity, intelligence, honesty, and a strong work ethic.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat logo and stationery styles do you like (text only, image only, text and image, etc.)?\r\nWe are open to an image or design as well as the name for branding purposes. The text should be relatively simple and easy to read from a distance. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat colors do you want to see in your logo and stationery?\r\nMy first company, Air Force Excavating (also branded on Crowdspring) used red, blue, and black in the logo. I like these as a possible colors for Scion Group as well. Another color option would be High-Vis yellow, instead of red, which seems to work well with blue and black.
