I am working with my dad to publish a book of 27 different stories about events/stories that occurred during Greg's amateur and pro baseball career through the ‘60’s, 70’s, and 80’s. Each chapter will begin with the words, “The Day That”, and the title of the book will be “The Day The Yankees Made Me Shave”. Story subjects will be about Greg’s personal recollections of playing in the famous Pine Tar Game in Yankee Stadium, playing shortstop in the Disco Demolition game in Comiskey Park, being a member of the 1985 World Series Champion Kansas City Royals, being called a dumbass by George Steinbrenner, loaning George Brett his bat when George stroked his 2,000th hit, hitting 3 walk-off home runs, and many other notable events. Our target audience is sports fans worldwide, since many of the stories in the book relate to various teams, Hall of Fame players, and widely recognized baseball events. Greg Pryor was a pro baseball player for 16 years, has been married for 37 years, a father of 3 daughters, a small business owner of a health & nutrition company, and a grandfather of 2. He desires to make sure that his descendants have access to a personal account of the most interesting events that he experienced in his baseball career.","cover_size":"6x9","select_colors":[["BBDEFB","90CAF9","64B5F6","42A5F5","2196F3","1E88E5","1976D2","1565C0","0D47A1"],["f44336","4CAF50","2196F3","FFEB3B","673AB7","FF9800","00BCD4","795548","777777"],["eeeeee","d0d0d0","b2b2b2","949494","777777","595959","3B3B3B","1D1D1D","000000"]],"industry":"publishing-and-media"},"brief_questions":[{"validations":["required"],"help":"","label":"Summarize your project.","name":"description","type":"textarea","answer_label":"Project Summary","description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
