I’ve included preliminary back cover copy below to give you a sense of the book’s focus. But my primary interest here is the front of the book. The cover’s design will likely be very critical to the book’s success as it while the deals with a timely and “popular” topic, its thinking will be challenging for many people. \n\nI invite people’s ideas and imagination. The book addresses personal questions but it a takes a very big picture approach with a lot of content that is more conceptual.  Please take a look at the two examples attached, I challenge you to come up with something that lean more towards the conceptual and abstract head space.  I’m using CrowdSpring as I think it highly likely that something unexpected might provide the best solution.  \n\nOn the Evolution of Intimacy:\n\nIn no aspects of life today do we confront more rapid and easily confusing change than in the worlds of gender and intimacy. Men and women equally are left without clear guideposts for their choices. In this short book, one of our time’s most innovative social scientists and futurists offers big-picture perspective for making sense of why we see what we do and what lies ahead. He describes an essential new chapter in identity and love, one that takes us beyond the battle of the sexes and brings new depth and maturity to both how we understand ourselves and our capacity for closeness with another.\n\nplease note that the concept of the book is not limited to heterosexual relationship, please take that into consideration when submitting your designs, would like to see how you can convey the diversity and complexity of all types of relationships in a simple yet novel graphical representation.","company":"ICDPress is the publishing arm of the Insitute for Creative Development, a Seattle-based think tank and center for advanced leadership training.  \n \nAbout the author -- Charles M.
