is the exact name you would like in your logo?\r\nMidnight Coffee Creative\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is your industry?\r\n Internet\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the top 3 things you would like to communicate through your logo?\r\nMidnight Coffee Creative is a new creative agency specializing in website design, custom coding and specialized branding. With that in mind, here are the three things we would like our logo to communicate:\r\n\r\n1. Our company name is inspired by the following image:\r\n\r\nIts the dead of the night, and two guys stand over a worktable in a creative studio, their sleeves rolled up, generating fresh ideas amid documents, sketches, artwork, laptops, crumbs and empty coffee cups. This is the hour where great ideas are born. Sunrise be damned.\r\n\r\nNOTE: We do NOT want this image incorporated into the logo literally. Instead, we want the feeling of this image to inspire the logo.\r\n\r\n2.  Our company, and the team behind it, are HIP and CREATIVE, yet TECH SAVY and PROFESSIONAL. Think tech cool.\" We want the logo to convey this duality.\r\n\r\n3. Midnight Coffee Creative is a mid-sized, boutique creative agency.  Were not a huge conglomerate where clients can get lost in a sea of projects, and were not a twelve-year-old coding in his parents basement.  Our team is in that sweet-spot: large enough to tackle complex, custom projects, but small enough to maintain constant one-on-one communication with our clients throughout the creative process. Were approachable, available, and we dont want our logo to be intimidating.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat logo styles do you like (image + text, image only, text only, etc.)\r\nIdeally the logo is a combination of image icon + text, but that can be separated out so that either the image icon or the text can stand on its own without the other.  This means that the image icon and text should compliment each other, but not be incorporated into one another.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have any other info or links you want to share?\r\nOur favorite logos are sleek, clean, and minimalist. They combine two ideas into a single, combined image.  The icon doesnt necessarily need to be a literal image of something (but it can if its awesome).  Ultimately, the icon should represent the creative, hard-working attitude of our team.\r\n\r\nWe also own two entertainment companies.  Here are their websites + logos so you can familiarize yourself with our design aesthetic and tastes:\r\n\r\nCameo Content - http://cameocontent.com\r\nSmall Red Cape - http://smallredcape.com\r\n\r\nAlso worth noting: because we hail from the entertainment industry, many of our website clients are in artistic fields.  Our target audience consists of: Artists, Entertainers, Weddings, Small Businesses, Online Merchants, and Startups.\r\n\r\nBecause Midnight Coffee Creative is all about custom solutions to our clients, we need to make sure that our logo feels just as custom to our company as our products will to our customers. The logo for Midnight Coffee Creative should not be obvious or feel derivative of any generic images or icons (clipart makes us gag). The most obvious symbols for the name Midnight Coffee would be a moon and a coffee cup, but we strongly encourage you to push past this imagery and show us something new, unique and fresh.\r\n\r\nIt is also important to note that we are a creative agency and NOT a diner or coffee shop. We do not want the logo to feel like it could be confused with the restaurant industry.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to seeing the work from the www.crowdspring.community!","legacy_brief_sections":[{"questions":[{"legacy_domid":"id_logo_exact_name","value":"Midnight Coffee Creative","name":"logo_exact_name","legacy_field_id":1053072,"label":"What is the exact name you would like in your logo?"},{"legacy_domid":"id_your_industry","value":"Internet","name":"your_industry","legacy_field_id":1053073,"label":"What is your industry?"},{"legacy_domid":"id_logo_top_communicate","value":"Midnight Coffee Creative is a new creative agency specializing in website design, custom coding and specialized branding.
