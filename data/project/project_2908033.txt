However, we've been thinking of using a Magenta type color specifically Color Hex #800080 for some of the tool components. But if you come up with color combinations that are different - don't hesitate to submit. We may well be persuaded that you're right. \n\nLogo/Text Location on Upper Shaft - See Attachment \n\nFile format must be vector and editable. It must scalable so that your text and imagery on the design that will wrap an aluminum tube (the primary shaft). Dimensions of the tube (diameter, circumference and desired length and width of design is shown on an attachment. \n\nMagenta does not necessarily appear strikingly in contrast to gun metal color. Perhaps you can figure a way to incorporate the magenta with gun metal colors and other contrasting colors. We suspect the Magenta against gun metal will need to strongly contrasted with lines around letters, or images or background colors on the edge. \n\nIf nothing else -- for the words Swap Tools must \"pop\" out to catch the eye of a consumer and user as this tool will sold online and in retail stores. We want the logo design to be eye-catching - reaching out to they eyes and then quickly to ignite the consumers mind to ask - \"hmmm, what do we have here?  I've never seen a tool like this and it seems pretty cool. I'm going to check it out\". \n\nThe perimeter of the logo should have an color that is in high contrast with the gun metal dark gray of the aluminum shaft upon which the logo sticker or graphic will be adhered. In other words, we want the logo framed. \n\nIf you feel like it, the text can be on each side of the tool or down the middle of the outward facing tool shaft and the logo imagery on the sides. Designers choice. If you choose to put the text on the outward facing front of the shaft, then text letters must be vertically stacked from top down. There's not enough room diameter wise to have letters be horizontal on the narrow outward facing front section of the shaft.  Vertically stacking the letters will give you mass.

Our product is called SwapTools. \n\nWith SWAP Tools one can swap out various implements with others to create our universal and multi-purposed tool. The SWAP Tool will have a line of interchangeable Implements that will be sold in the following segments - lawn and garden, house/facility cleaning and maintenance and painting/surface coating. Other uses will evolve but this is the main focus for now. \n\nThe tool will be sold in stores and on-line and some of the best known retail store brands are interested in carrying this new line of multi-purposed tool. \n\nBelow are two links to videos with the founder talking about the tool and how it works. You will only see two implements, the weeder and the hoe/digger in use. \n\nIMPORTANT NOTE:  the tool shown in the video is an alpha version. \n\n     1.  You see green used for tool color. Tentative new colors are now black, gun metal dark gray and a magenta (tone of purple) - Hex Color #800080. However - the magenta is not a final decision. You may think about SWAP Tools and it's target audience and it's many uses and think another color is better. Go for it. \n\n     2. The video and other attachments shows a D Handle (shape of a D).  The final version of the handle is a called a Diamond Handle. It is in shape of diamond. You can see the shape of the Diamond Handle in one of the attachments. \n\n     3.  You'll see in the videos that we call the tool The Green Mamba.  Now we call it SWAP Tools.\nCut and paste to get to the videos:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7z04OvHI5o\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRpA0eUtbA&t=6s\n\nWe often refer to the tool components as a Primary Tool or Driver and, separate from the Drive, there are many different interchangeable Implements. The Primary Driver is a tool platform. An analogy will help your understanding.  Think of our Driver as an OS and Implements as Applications. MacOS is to its many Applications as SWAP Tools Primary Shaft is to it's many Implements. \n\nWe have created something outside the crowded/cluttered center of industry tools. We have cushioned grips - not rubbery but soft but durable; the side handle is shaped much like the latest innovation in baseball bats with the axe handle (for comfort, alignment of wrists/arms/hands and stabilizing swing); a weeder prong that is slightly wider at the end for a wider berth around roots (aka a wider sweet spot); sturdy aluminum shafts; resizeable tool length; martial arts principles and techniques at work in design and use; embedded power of the 45 degree angle (gaining recognition as an ideal angle of launch, leverage and accuracy, in sports for example. The triangular nature of user/tool and ground survace (user 90 degrees perpendicular), tool extended (45 degrees) back to the base of the user at 45 degrees). This is a special triangle and induces good posture and healthy stanze among other attributes.  Properly used, Golden Spiral principles are at work in the spin of our tool (the rotation of the weeding tool when spun around a weed and simulataneously lifted from the ground, mirrors the golden spiral). Newtonian laws/principles in motion and dealing with the push back of things in opposition to one another (force of the drive of the tool into soil and soil push back); careful attention to biomechanics (tool in harmony with task to promote efficiency and health).  \n\nWe anticipate our target audience to be early Millennial and GenX plus Boomers. Many have discretionary income, active lifestyles, like to keep their belongings and surroundings looking well kept/maintained; yards tended to and houses clean. They are pressed for time and need to be efficient. Though they may hire people to do work in and around the house, they are also at times Do-it-Yourself'ers\".  \n\nWhat is the Why of this Product?  \n\nThere are a number of problems in use of hand-held tools that our product addresses and resolves. \n\nHand-held tools (human power generated),  1) often require a user to twist wrists, elbows, shoulders, spine, knees and feet. This puts pressure on the biomechanical system and increases risk of pain, strain and even injury on or to the body. Our tool has embedded into it's design and form the means to induce good posture, less strain on the body, is easy to use. \n\nWhen manuevered by the user, slight bursts of human generated rotation or spin of the entire tool from Diamond Handle to the end of any implement, allows for speed and mitigation of pressure on the biomechanical sytem. By analogy, this is a result similar that which is called \"soft power\" in the martial arts. It's all about techique, position, stanze, quick bursts of power and leveraging. \n \nThe tool has a side handle (shown in illustrations) that can be detached from the main Driver and then used to connect the same implements but to be used when kneeling on the ground our sitting cross-legged or doing tasks that need a shorter handle, such as with a duster, clipping stems or hand-brush painting. Our tool does not only have interchangeable Implements, it has an interchangeable Driver (one long and other short). \n\nWhen being used as a long handle tool, the user is to size the length of the tool to be comfortably held at the waist and the end touching the ground at a 45 degree angle. The 45 degree nature of tool positioning is extremely important to ergonometry and ease of use. Check the attached illustrations out. The user stands at 90 degrees, the tool angles at 45 degrees and the user and tool connect via another 45 degree angle back to the user. This is a special angle for efficiency, safety, accuracy, minimalist action, maximum result. \n\nThe body works efficiently, with the swift rotation of the tool, fast and in harmony with the human bodies natural movements.   \n\nAnother why:  \n\nThere is an enormous amout of money spent on tools that are all separate. This works to the capital/revenue manufacturers and brand name benefit - not the consumer. The above average, higher quality, comparable tools to what we offer and will offer, costs on average $30. This is for one tool. Our tool is multi-purposed and our cost-benefit will far exceed that of individually bought separate tools. \n\nAnother Why: \n\nWhy do most hand held tools, conventional in design and operation, look so boring - many highly complicated to use, always using mundane colors.  Manufacturers and brand owners tend to gravitate to the center of the crowd. SWAP Tools is an outlier and will not only to change how work is done, but we want our Logo to inspire an emotional connection with customers. If some people will buy a high end coffee maker instead of an inexpensive one, or a high end bicycle instead of a basic one at a mainstream big box retailer, they will buy SWAP Tools. Some people are looking only at cost - our target market is looking for quality, brand validation/recognition and relative price-value.\n\nAnother Why:  Garages and closets are cluttered with all kinds of gardening,household and painting tools, poles, shafts and this not only takes up valuable space, it gets confusing on which tool does what when people have multiple rakes, hoes, cultivators, weeders, mops, brooms and on and on. We SIMPLIFY all of this for the user. One shaft (our Driver) and smaller Implements that will stored in a simple tie string tote bag. \n\nLOGO - Make the Consumer's brain light up when they see our Logo and name. Take some risks with your work. Maybe you speaks to the angle of use, rotation, burst of energy, ergonomics, and multi-purpose/versatility.  The mystic values inherent in a tool that works best at a 45 degree angle. What we call \"the magic angle\" that is incorporated twice in the special triangle.  \nA Golden Spiral. A Diamond Handle. Here, I make suggestions - not directions - maybe you come up with a character or logos - somewhat mystical such as with Starbucks; the encoded/mystical pyramid on the US Dollar bill; Freemason symbol, other mysterious symbols found throughout time, etc. The Crowdspring creatives can work within these parameters or push the edge and go in a different but relatable direction.  \n\n Question: What are unique core elements of the tool design and function that seems to strike you as useful to incorporate into your logo design? Which will tell a good story about what the tool and its benefits are? \n\n"},"brief_questions":[{"help":"","type":"textarea","answer_label":"Project Summary","description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
