But we've updated the other graphics and UI on the site, and when we asked our users what they thought, they said the logo \"looked like clip art\".  We need a logo that looks like it fits in with the rest of the site design, and that expresses what the site does. \r\n\r\nOUR TARGET AUDIENCE IS:\r\n\r\nOur user community consists of brainstormers (creative folks who like to brainstorm), and customers (people who \"hire\" our crowd to help come up with great ideas.  There are also people who just come to the site and don't sign up.  We want to make sure that the design increases our credibility with all of those audiences.\r\n\r\nWE LIKE THESE DESIGNS:\r\n\r\nWell, we like the design of the facebook, twitter, and rss logos we use on the site.  These were open source.  They have a nice illuminated or 3D quality to them!  \r\n\r\nWE ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE (or we don't want to see) THIS IN OUR DESIGN:\r\n\r\nWe don't want the new logo to look like clip art again...  It is OK if the logo resembles the current one, and we are also interested in seeing totally new designs.  The colors used should coordinate with the colors used on the site (it has a simple, primary-color-based scheme)."},"brief_questions":[{"validations":["required"],"label":"Summarize your project.","type":"textarea","description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
