It does not need to be youth-culture, i.e. MTV, but it needs to be attractive to the Facebook generation. Building upon the MTV point, parents need to see the site as professional and safe. Ultimately the site needs to communicate that students can very easily get cost effective help in any subject matter at any time of day from other students at top schools in America.\n\n\nHow is your company different from your competitors?\nOur site offers instant access to high quality tutors at competitive prices.
