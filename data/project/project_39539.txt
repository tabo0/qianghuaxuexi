We will do this by breaking down preconceptions people have of whisky, and through an experiential introduction to whisky, its myriad of different products, flavours and tastes.\r\n\r\nWe currently do whisky tastings, have a whisky club and provide whisky based entertainment at events (parties, product launches, art exhibitions etc), but will be branching out into whisky based tourism, and sales of whisky and related merchandise.\r\n\r\nWe are not whisky bores seeking to educate people on every detail of whisky.  We are people who have fun with the product and enjoy its taste.  The mysticism and romanticism surrounding whisky itself and how it is made is all well and good, but we feel this sometimes gets in the way of the fact that whisky is simply a great tasting drink (e.g. one of our marketing slogons is stop drinking, start tasting).\r\n\r\nWe are also keen to promote a fresher, contemporary image of Scotland and its culture while also acknowledging the image of Scotland people know and love (tartan, bagpipes etc). We will achieve this through the promotion of our brand Simply Whisky.  Our brand will be leveraged so that we become the new global face of Scotland and whisky.\r\n\r\nThe logo should convey the idea that we are approaching whisky differently, and so it should be eye catching, memorable and fun (see point 1 above).  At the same time we don't want to turn away older people in their 30s and 40s who are still part of our target market (see point 2 above).\r\n\r\nOur customers range from the more traditional legal, accountancy, finance, and private members clubs crowds through to music festivals, graffiti art exhibitions, party crowd in Ibiza etc.  \r\n\r\nMarkets will be Britain, America, China and Japan and so the design should work well with or without a tagline.  For example, we use taglines for our different products and services depening on the market we are approaching.  Our whisky tastings service has a tagline 'Loch, Scots and Two Oaken Barrels' which we know works in London, but will need to be changed for e.g. China.\r\n\r\nThe logo should communicate that we are people-oriented, and could symbolise a coming together of people for enjoyment.  In Scotland we have a traditional cup of welcome called a 'quaich' for bestowing good wishes upon greeting or parting, it has become scotland's cup of friendship.  We also want our logo to indicate that we are impartial and don't represent any particular distillery, that we only work with the best people and products in our industry, and that high quality is very important to us and that everything we do is with our own unique style and panache.\r\n\r\nAt the moment our brand is us (see www.theislayexperience.com).  This might be difficult to appreciate without meeting us.  We have had modern kilts made (www.21stcenturykilts.com) and realise there are marketing opportunities that come from portraying ourselves as gentlemen about town having fun. We intend to have new photos done against a more modern background.\r\n\r\nThe design should work at a variety of sizes from 2 inches (screen) to 12 feet (print).  The design must be entirely original, and should not conflict with existing trademarks.\r\n\r\nExamples of logos we like: Redbull, www.tinthepark.com, www.albannach.co.uk, www.monkeyshoulder.com, www.Fenchurch.com, James Bond (007), the kilted stick men we drew on our business cards (see attachment)\r\n\r\nExamples of logos we don't like: www.whiskymag.com, www.ardbeg.com, www.carling.com, Marks and Spencer, existing whisky logos in general (too boring), logos that use the letters of the company (in our case that would be SW).","legacy_brief_sections":[],"description":null},"brief_questions":[{"description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
