We add value with our unique understanding of the intersection of business, communities and social technologies.\r\n\r\nThe 20:20 Social approach to Social Business Strategy is rooted in the belief that positive conversations are driven by positive experiences, which can be collaboratively designed, and result in the coming together of evangelist communities.\r\n\r\nWe develop a strategy to use social technologies to deliver business results, including collaborative product and process design, trial, purchase and advocacy. Then, we develop design specifications and detailed tactical plans, select technology and service partners, define metrics and measurement processes, oversee implementation and share responsibility for business results and ROI.\r\n\r\n20:20 Media, the parent organization, is a leading PR firm in India and was voted last year Indian PR Agency of the Year. \r\n\r\nHERE IS WHAT WE NEED:\r\n\r\nLogo, stationary (letterhead, envelop, and visiting card), and Power Point template.\r\n\r\nOUR TARGET AUDIENCE IS:\r\n\r\nWe typically engage with C-Level executives at Fortune 500 companies.\r\n\r\nThe logo should be attractive to marketing, communications and business professionals ranging from mid-management to C-level. The design should be consistent with typically held beliefs and values globally (especially US and India), and should convey an organization character expected of a strategic partner for Fortune 500 companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWE LIKE THESE DESIGNS:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.crowdspring.com\r\nhttp://www.groupsite.com/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWE ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE (or we don't want to see) THIS IN OUR DESIGN:\r\n\r\nElements related to business strategy, conversations, collaboration, and community.\r\n\r\nThe primary logo color for 20:20 Media is red, with gray and white accents. We don't have to follow this color scheme for the 20:20 Social logo. The present 20:20 Social logo is blue.","legacy_brief_sections":[],"description":null},"brief_questions":[{"description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
