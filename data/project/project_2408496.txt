The stickers are different shapes. Our Fade Away product is like a roll of tape that when trimmed needs the Stay Put to hold into place. \n\n\nWhat is your industry?\n Health Care and Biotech\n\n\nDescribe the target audience for your package graphics\nWe want to target women who have plastic surgery with upscale modern design. This package must match the package in our line. The new product is a complimentary add on product that helps secure the Silicone Sheeting in Place. \n\nWe want the packaging to look like it could be a cosmetic package even though it is actually a medical items. \n\n\nWhat 3 things would you like to communicate to your audience through your package graphics design?\n1) Continuity of Design. Remember this product has the same foot print as the other product and it is sold as a package together. \n2) We want the product package to show the purpose of the product. In this case the  product is adhesive tabs that help stick on the silicone sheeting tape by securing the tabs to either side of the skin to help it stay on (see instructions step #4). Also, see how we visualize the product - note that we still need the item designed so please stylize the attached ideas - don't just copy it. \n3) \n\n\nWhat package graphics design styles do you like?\nWe like the package we have. Let's keep w/ the style but communicate the new product. \n\n\nWhat colors do you want to see in your package graphics design?\nWe want to use the same blue as the other product and in this one any new colors added to the pallet should be metallics (silver, gold, bronze)\n\n\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your package graphics design?\nToo bright and different colors than original package \n\n\nWhat adjectives should best describe your package graphics design?\nCool, smart, beautiful \n\n\nWhat content must be included in the package graphics design?\n1) Front Area must have line name and product name w/ content. \n\n2) Back must have area for instructions (for this use the text that is on the designed box). \n\n3) the Stay Put portion must have room for us to add the different Stay Put shapes name under stay put.\n\n\n\nDo you have additional info or links you'd like to share?\nYes. Few items: \n1. See box of existing products \n2. See Step #4 of how to use the line. \n3a. See mock up and idea of stay put. We like the idea of something being stuck and secured to the box w/ tape/tabs which communicates what our product does. Note that the attached mockup also has the content needed from the front. \n3b. See StayPut w/ version w/ heart shapes. I am not asking you to design this but need to show how it should be flexible. \n4.
