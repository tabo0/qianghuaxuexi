My mother and I are starting this start-up, woofbuddy.com or \"woof buddy\" for short. We just recently got venture funding and are thus on our way to starting the website. Simply put, Woof Buddy is going to be an interactive website for dogs. Humans will be able to create profiles for their dogs & then connect webcams to their dog's living area and broadcast live during the day to the website. This will then create 2-way conversations between dogs through our website. In other words, video chat for dogs. Sound crazy enough? So, we will be posting two projects on crowdspring. First we need a logo  & second we need a website design. This submission is for a logo. Website submission wil be after a logo design is chosen. I have already created \"prototype logos\" for you to try and give you an idea of what we  are looking for. We must stress that the logo give definite hints of dogs + video chat. Maybe even stress the woof part and buddy part. Anyways we are really happy to be able to post this on this website. Otherwise we would have had to use my idea which is a little under-developed.\r\n\r\nWe came up with this idea when we saw our dog \"buddy\" being bored constantly everyday. My mother works full-time and I was a senior in high school during the year. It wasn't enough to simply turn on Animal Planet and expect him to be into it. After all, most of the shows on animal planet have to do with Elephants, Whales, and Lions. Only about 10% would show dogs. So this idea is not for us, it is for dogs everywhere including \"Buddy\" who find themselves bored during the day. So when you are doing this, you are helping dogs everywhere!   :)\r\n\r\n\r\nREAD THIS! \r\n\r\nTHIS IS MY PROMISE TO ANYONE WHO SUBMITS A DESIGN. I WILL LOOK AT EVERY SINGLE DESIGN AND PROMISE TO COMMENT ON EVERY SINGLE ONE SUBMITTED. AFTER ALL I HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO DO BECAUSE IT IS SUMMER & I REALLY WANT EVERYONE TO HAVE AN EQUAL SHOT AT WINNING.\r\n\r\nHERE IS WHAT WE NEED:\r\n\r\nWe need a logo that is similar to the prototype one I made. However, I definately want this to be an opportunity for you creatives out there to have creative freedom. If you feel like you have the mona lisa equivalent for this logo, then please do not hesitate to submit it. I am a very open minded person. The logo like I said should stress video chat or dogs in some way. However we do not want a cluttered logo. If your at odds as to what to do, simply look at some of the files I have uploaded. I have a few different takes on what it should look like. I do like the glassy bubble look of the video chat icon. This logo will be used on the website mainly. There might be promotional materials but it will mainly be used on the website. I would also like a file with the logo on a transparent background so it can be used on any picture. I am not good enough at photoshop to erase the background. I tried already with mine and it left too many white spots.\r\n\r\nOUR TARGET AUDIENCE IS:\r\n\r\nOur audience is anyone in the world who is a dog lover and isn't afraid to use technology to benefit their dogs. In other words, most likely it will appeal to the younger tech-savvy generation who can hookup a webcam to a television and computer. We want to appeal as a young start-up. In other words design for a younger generation.\r\n\r\nWE LIKE THESE DESIGNS:\r\n\r\nDesign wise there aren't really any logos that I can think of that would apply. Although I did get the color scheme idea for my rough draft logo from the youku.com logo. I liked the colors blue and red together but that's about all I liked about that logo. As for that the only other idea I can give is that I do like the glass look of the ichat bubble icon. I provided one I found. It just looks really cool. LOL. The rest is up to you creatives! \r\n\r\nWE ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE (or we don't want to see) THIS IN OUR DESIGN:\r\n\r\nOnly thing we do not want to see is clutter. We want clean and start-up looking. We want unique so in other words, no copycats."},"brief_questions":[{"validations":["required"],"label":"Summarize your project.","type":"textarea","description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
