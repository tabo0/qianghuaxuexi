Yours, Shed\r\n\r\nHERE IS WHAT WE NEED:\r\n\r\nBRIEF FOR CREDIT CRUNCH CEREAL BOX\r\n\r\nAll this is up for your interpretation. Our single aim is to create a spectacular and iconic design.\r\n\r\n\tWe are designing a new brand of cereal called CREDIT CRUNCH \r\n\r\n\tA parallel aim is to get this cereal to reported on by the media in a big way. Therefore, I expect that if your design is used on the finished product, it will be seen all over the world. \r\n\r\n\tThe actual cereal inside the box is 3D, wheat-coloured, little symbols of four currencies  YEN, DOLLAR, POUND and EURO (see attached photo of the first samples)\r\n\r\n\t**IMPORTANT** Any design I choose will have to be updated and finalised with the final cereal symbols shapes, the correct weight, nutritional information and beautifully photographed images of the shapes, bowl, milk (PVA glue is used to mimic milk apparently) and spoon\r\n\r\n\tWe are creating designs for two box sizes: The same design must ideally work for both. \r\n\r\nBOX SIZE 1 is: 125 mm high x 90 mm wide x 30 mm deep (depth may change to 31 or 32 mm deep at some point before the final print)\r\n\r\nBOX SIZE 2 is to be confirmed \r\n\r\n\tActual shapes will be around 17mm high, 4mm deep and approx 9mm wide but they can look supersized on your design.\r\n\r\n\tThis box should look like a Kelloggs cereal box  authenticity is key. \r\n\r\nBRIEF FOR THE BOX DESIGN: \t\r\n\r\nCREDIT CRUNCH is the title of the cereal. \r\n\r\nStrong, primary colours, Not too many colours, Visually impacting, Dynamic, Fun, Think MasculinePowerfulIconic\r\n\r\n\tThe typeface for Credit Crunch should be modern, funky, dynamic, possibly with a black or navy outline, possibly with shadow and with movement -  to have more than just a normal linear shape perhaps what were looking for is an iconic bold logo that jumps out at the viewerit definitely must look designed and not just two words from a font please\r\n\r\n\tThe title 'Credit Crunch' is trademarked so you can add either a  (TM) symbol or a registered trademark symbol   near the title if you think it looks good. \r\n\r\n\tLets definitely have the words Breakfast Cereal somewhere on the box and the weight too, which (for now) is 30g \r\n\r\n\tOptional  to have these words: The food of choice in difficult times on the packet somewhere. Most important thing is that it mustnt look like a spoof, it should look like a real supermarket product.\r\n\r\n\tThe iconic Nutritional content symbols and the information they contain seem like a  \r\nrecognisable signifier of cereal so I would suggest (but not insist, if you think it spoils the design) we place those on as well if they fit in with your design. \r\n\r\n\tIn the final version, we should include photographed images of the actual cereal shapes on the box  and a bowl with them in, with milk, maybe with the shapes being scooped by a spoon with milk and shapes in it, maybe the shapes are falling in to the bowl I realise these are all rather clichd images, but the thinking is to ensure the box is immediately recognisable as breakfast cereal. The actual cereal shapes will be coming over from China soon.  \r\n\r\nTo be clear: the bowl, spoon and cereal shapes will need to photographed professionally (by you  or arranged by you) and then added to the final design. This is all included in the winners fee. \r\n\r\nPlease only pitch designs for the front of the box first  this is the hardest thing to get right. Once I pick the winner, then we can work on the sides. \r\n\r\nTo be clear-  the wining price includes the design of all sides and top and bottom and two sizes of box (same design though)thanks!  \r\n\r\n\tSame graphic on front and back of box, for both less work and ease of stacking? Maybe different colours on front and back though. \r\n\r\nTHE OTHER SIDES OF THE BOX \r\n\r\n\tAll sides of the packet (including the top, bottom, sides, front and back) will need to be designed in the final instance please and the winner will receive the brief for the other sides and the top and bottom after the winner is announced...\r\n\r\nLooking forward to seeing your work and I hugely appreciate you taking the time to pitch.   \r\n\r\nThanks so much,\r\n\r\nYours, Shed x\r\n\r\nOUR TARGET AUDIENCE IS:\r\n\r\nSee above.\r\n\r\nWE LIKE THESE DESIGNS:\r\n\r\nSee attached pictures.\r\n\r\nWE ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE (or we don't want to see) THIS IN OUR DESIGN:\r\n\r\nSee above.","legacy_brief_sections":[],"description":null},"brief_questions":[{"validations":["required"],"help":"","label":"Summarize your project.","name":"description","type":"textarea","answer_label":"Project Summary","description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
