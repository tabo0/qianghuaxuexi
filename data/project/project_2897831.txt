By that we mean something that is well-conceived and typical of national brands.  A local sign designer prepared a window screen mock up for us that literally looked like a blown up business card slapped on our window.  That is definitely not what we're looking for.  But an image is worth a thousand words, so we will attach pictures of some window screens that we like around our city.","initial_content":"We are not your conventional vehicle wrap project.  In fact, we don’t need a vehicle wrap at all!  We need a store front window design for a long stretch of windows on our building that faces a major intersection in our city.  The good folks at CrowdSpring advised us to list this project in the vehicle wrap category because you guys are used to working within specific dimensional constraints. \n\nWe're looking for a design that is eye-catching and polished, yet also effective.  While we don't want a cluttered design, we still need to artfully communicate more than one message:\n\n1. Our brand (the Comfort Dental logo will be attached) \n2. Our phone number (505-890-2773) very visible from the street.  \n3. Our hours: Mon- Friday 7:30AM-7:30 PM and Saturday from 7:30 Am-1:30 PM\n4. New Patients Welcome\n\nOther phrases that may be used in the design are “Braces,” “Medicaid Welcome,” “Open Late,” “Convenient Hours,”  “Most Dental Insurances Accepted,” “All ages welcome.” \n\nIn the end, the goal is to bring in new patients.  You can be creative in how you convey the most important messaging.  For instance, it may be more efficient to say we have “Convenient Hours” or “Night and Weekend Hours,” rather than listing the hours.  We defer to your marketing and design expertise.\n\nThe winning design will also mesh well with the colors of the building, which are listed below (they are all Sherwin Williams):\n\n- SW 7012 Creamy (261-C3)\n- SW 6113 Interactive Cream (291-C1)\n- SW 6116 Tatami Tan (291-C5)\n- SW 2803 Rookwood Terra Cotta \n- SW 2808 Rookwood Dark Brown\n- SW Bronzetone Custom Colors - Mississippi Bronze\n\nWe are aware that our logo does not coordinate well with the colors of the building, but we are hoping that the design can tie it in by using a couple of the more neutral colors in the building color scheme (perhaps SW7012 Creamy and/or Rookwood Dark Brown and Mississippi Bronze).\n\nWe are not at all opposed to the use of stock images, including images of people.  We are also open to conventional and more trendy designs.  \n\nWe took some pictures of window screens around our city that we like to give you a general idea of what we’re hoping to see.  We will attach them for your review.  But please do not allow these images to limit your creativity.  You may have a different idea that we haven’t see in our market yet that we might like even more.  \n\nWe will also attach a few images of the building, the dimensions of the windows to be covered with the screen and our logo.  \n","vehicle_kind":"other","select_fonts":["no_preference"],"industry":"health-care-and-biotech","company":"We are a dental franchise located all over the US, but primarily in the Southwest.  We focus on affordable, high-quality dental care for a range of patients.  Our fees are often much lower than other providers, we honor most insurance (including Medicaid), and we even offer our own affordable insurance program.  All of this makes us particularly attractive to working families and our target market is the demographic in the middle to lower income bracket.","anything_else":"Please feel free to break up the window screen on the far left-hand corner panel with some smaller \"stickers\" if you see fit.  We have included some images of how smaller stickers might be implemented as well.\n\nIn the pictures \"Our Building 1\" and \"Our Building 2\" you can see the window panels we're covering with the screen.  We need a sense of our brand on the window screen, but we don't want it to look like a photocopy of the large \"Comfort Dental\" lighted sign we have on the pavillion right above the windows.\n\nIn the document titled \"Window Measurement,\" which was generated by the company that will be installing the screens, please use the dimensions in Option 1.  This option covers all our windows.","create-account":{"email":"bissiasbrown@gmail.com"},"top_3":"1. Our brand (the Comfort Dental logo is attached) \n2.
