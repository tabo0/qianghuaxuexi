Probably half of our customers are based in the United States, a quarter are based in Europe/UK and the rest of the customers are based in the Middle East and Asia.  Most are quite technical, well informed and pretty intelligent. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat 3 things would you like to communicate to your audience through your logo and stationery?\r\nStability, Dependable, Competence.  We are a relatively new company with well recognized personnel from other companies with lots of years of experiance.  Most of our customers are considerably larger than we are and we want our logo and public image to help foster confidence in us and a desire to do business with us.  I have seen other companies that have \"cutsie\" logos or a cartoonish look and those tend to come off as immediate turn offs.  \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat logo and stationery styles do you like (text only, image only, text and image, etc.)?\r\nWe will consider all three.  I will provide list s of logo's that I like/admire\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat colors do you want to see in your logo and stationery?\r\nWe already have a logo that is mainly blue (that we are replacing) but are not necessarily wanting to stay with that color.  We are not design experts so we are interested in what colors the designers suggest.  That being said, for some reason Orange resonates well to us.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your logo and stationery?\r\nEarthy colors like brown and olive are probably not a fit but again, we are not ruling anything out yet. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat adjectives should best describe your logo and stationery?\r\nCompetent, Capable, Agile, Experienced\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere will your logo be used (print, website, etc.)?\r\nLetterhead (usually on documents sent via e-mail as PDF's), Business Cards, Web Site (which we don't yet have) and in Power Point presentations.  \r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have additional info or links you want to share?\r\nSee the file: AAP Indentity Final OLT.  That is the current logo but we are ready to replace it.   IAP Logo is one from a previous business that I like.  We used it with and with out the words \"Aviation Partners\" listed below.
