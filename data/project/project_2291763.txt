It's being used commercially in places all over the world. It is, however, particularly effective new way for Non Profits to 'touch' their constituents and potential supporters. Most non-profits send out emails and newsletters, neither of which can impart much emotional content. Non profits that now use GoldMail have had fantastic results, for the simple reason that voice & visuals combined is far more engaging and motivating and text and/or pictures. Our company is part owned by a non-profit - and we are giving one year of our business service (normally $99/year) away for free to up to 1 million bona fide non profits.  We want a page that compels the viewer (a non profit professional or volunteer) to jump at the FREE GOLDMAIL opportunity.","legacy_brief_text":"Business Name\r\nGoldMail, Inc.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you do?\r\nProvide a simple way for anyone to create a powerful, audio-visual message that can be shared through email or posted anywhere on line (Facebook, Youtube,LinkedIn, etc.) Our product sells for $99/year, but we are giving it away - for free - no strings - to up to 1 million non-profits\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have a desired website screen size?\r\nStandard (like the existing one)\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many pages (maximum of 5) do you need designed?\r\n1 - possibly two\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is your industry?\r\nInternet Communications\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe the target audience for your website design\r\nThis page is for non-profits, particularly smaller and mid-sized.
