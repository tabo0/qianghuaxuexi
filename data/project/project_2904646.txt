Why lose an hour every night reciting dribble? We're blowing the doors off of story-time, getting real, imparting some timeless wisdom, and still having a laugh or three. Turning kids into success adults demands focus. The school system isn’t going to teach them about debt, finance, liberty, entrepreneurship, psychology, or even history. They’ll get fables, names and dates — the chopping of a cherry tree or landing of the Mayflower — but miss the real points, mangled to the point of propaganda. It’s our job as parents to help them understand how the world really works, to help them think independently, and question phony narratives.\n\nThe BadDaddy series will prepare them early for an unforgiving world, and educate, enlighten, and entertain the whole family. With the right stories, they’ll be masters of their own fate. Without it, they’ll be groomed to trust a broken system, and forced to learn the hard way. Due first is “Where does money come from?”, but we also need an illustrator for other titles in the queue include “Good-Debt, Bad-Debt”, “The Madness of Crowds”, “Right-Law, Wrong-Law” and “Fear and Greed”.\n\nWe’re injecting a bigger purpose into story-time, for self-reliant parents that want the best for their kids."},"brief_questions":[{"help":"","type":"textarea","answer_label":"Project Summary","description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
