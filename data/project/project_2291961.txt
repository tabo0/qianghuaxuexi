The project is an 8-10 page whitepaper creation on the topic of pay-per-click advertising, its impact on digital marketing, and ways to ensure a successful ad campaign for businesses today. The whitepaper should be educational and speak to a business audience. For the proposal, we ask for submissions to be a minimum of the first 2 pages of the whitepaper covering the introduction and first point, which are outlined below (2 pages minimum - more if you would like). Upon selection, we require the writer to produce the remaining pages to complete the 8-10 page whitepaper.","legacy_brief_sections":[{"label":"Business Info","questions":[{"label":"Business Name","legacy_domid":"id_article_name","value":"Research and Management","name":"Business Name","legacy_field_id":103319},{"label":"What do you do?","legacy_domid":"id_article_what_you_do","value":"Digital Marketing Consulting Franchise","name":"What do you do?","legacy_field_id":103320}],"legacy_field_id":103318,"name":"Business Info"},{"label":"Target Audience","questions":[{"label":"What is your industry?","legacy_domid":"id_article_industry","value":"Internet / Digital Media / Advertising / Consulting","name":"What is your industry?","legacy_field_id":103322},{"label":"Describe your audience","legacy_domid":"id_article_audience","value":"Our target audience includes business owners and marketing professionals from companies of all sizes and industries.","name":"Describe your audience","legacy_field_id":103323},{"label":"How do you intend to use this article, report or proposal (print, web, etc.)?","legacy_domid":"id_article_how_use","value":"We intend to distribute the whitepaper to our franchisee and end client network online.","name":"How do you intend to use this article, report or proposal (print, web, etc.)?","legacy_field_id":103324},{"label":"What 3 things would you like to communicate to your audience through this content?","legacy_domid":"id_article_3_things","value":"1) Brief explanation what pay-per-click advertising is \n2) Why businesses use PPC and its benefits\n3) Ways to ensure a powerful PPC campaign (tips/techniques)","name":"What 3 things would you like to communicate to your audience through this content?","legacy_field_id":103325}],"legacy_field_id":103321,"name":"Target Audience"},{"label":"Style and Details","questions":[{"label":"Do you have a title for this piece?","legacy_domid":"id_article_title","value":"Understanding Pay-Per-Click Advertising: 5 Ways to Ensure a Successful Ad Campaign","name":"Do you have a title for this piece?","legacy_field_id":103327},{"label":"Do you have a thesis or conclusion that must be reached?","legacy_domid":"id_article_thesis","value":"The whitepaper should conclude by emphasizing the importance of leveraging PPC advertising for businesses but more importantly specific ways to ensure a business develops a successful ad campaign.","name":"Do you have a thesis or conclusion that must be reached?","legacy_field_id":103328},{"label":"List all information that must be included","legacy_domid":"id_article_must_include","value":"- Introduction with a brief explanation of what PPC is and why it's important for businesses today\n- The benefits of PPC advertising for businesses\n- 5 Ways to Ensure a Successful Ad Campaign (this is where the \"meat\" of the whitepaper is)\n1) Effective keyword selection\n2) Negative keywords\n3) Focusing in on the niche and ad groups\n4) Writing successful ads\n5) Landing pages","name":"List all information that must be included","legacy_field_id":103329},{"label":"What character, tenor and spirit do you want to convey?","legacy_domid":"id_article_character","value":"Business-like, professional, educational, informational, but with a casual (non-techy) tone","name":"What character, tenor and spirit do you want to convey?","legacy_field_id":103330},{"label":"What is your required length in words or pages for this article, report or proposal?","legacy_domid":"id_article_length","value":"Proposal: first 2 pages of whitepaper, including introduction and first point","name":"What is your required length in words or pages for this article, report or proposal?","legacy_field_id":103331},{"label":"Do you want to include additional info?","legacy_domid":"id_article_additional_info","value":"The whitepaper should include recent statistical information related to the topic of pay-per-click advertising for businesses with relevant charts, graphs or supporting images.
