Our curriculum is authored by both LearnZillion’s Dream Team of top teachers from across the country, and LearnZillion’s high-quality content partners, like Illustrative Mathematics.  \n\nOur curriculum collections include: \nLZ Dream Team Math Curriculum, K-2\nLZ Dream Team Math Curriculum, 3-5\nLZ Illustrative Mathematics, 6-8\nLZ Guidebooks Language Arts, 3-5\nLZ Guidebooks Language Arts, 6-8 \n\nEach collection is organized by grade and each grade has ~12 units. Each unit is organized into lessons and assessments. \n","vision":"We’re looking for a header for each collection. The header should use LearnZillion’s colors (please view the color guide document uploaded below), capture LearnZillion’s personality (modern, elegant, teacher-friendly), and enable text and icon overlays (see LDOE Guidebooks example, referenced below).\n\nOur target audience consists of teachers, students, and school district leaders.\n\nWe'd describe our optimal header as being clean, simple, and elegant.","anything_else":"WE ARE OPEN TO MULTIPLE AWARDS.\n\nEach curricular collection will have its own header. \nWe’d like the header to fit our site’s overall look and feel: https://learnzillion.com/p/\nWe have provided guidelines for the header (as when the header is clicked, it will be expanded and resized within our site). \n\nPlease view the uploaded document to read through the guidelines.\n\nWe particularly like the style that’s used for our LDOE ELA Guidebooks because it’s clean, simple, elegant, and creates room to place different text or symbols inside it: https://learnzillion.com/resources/81666-english-language-arts-guidebook-units\n\nUnfortunately, we won’t be able to use this header after May 1st, since Louisiana will reclaim that version of the curriculum. We’re hoping to replace it with a new header. We also want to add consistent headers to the other collections referenced above. \n\nWe also like the design incorporated into the opening video of our homepage.
