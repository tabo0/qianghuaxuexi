Vitality City is an attempt to improve the well-being (physical, social and emotional) of an entire community; In this case, the beach cities of Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach, California.  The approach is unique.  Rather than trying to get people to change their behavior by applying more will power, we alter the environment so that the healthy choice becomes the easy choice.  For example, we work with communities to add more sidewalks and bike paths so that walking and biking become easy options.  We work with restaurants and grocery stores to adjust their menus and displays so healthy choices are more apparent, etc. We also work to create a social environment that encourages healthy behavior while discouraging unhealthy choices.  That is where a t-shirt can really help.  By wearing Vitality City t-shirts the initiative becomes more visible and \"cool\" which encourages more people to get involved.\n\nYou can learn more about the Vitality City initiative at the beta version of the website.  www.vitalitycity.com.
