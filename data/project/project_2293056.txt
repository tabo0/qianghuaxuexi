Users are likely to use social web 2.0 services such as Facebook, Gmail, Digg, Twitter. Users are people who regularly surf the web, read news articles, and share news articles, pictures, videos, and other content with their friends or followers. But users are not necessarily techies, the product is approachable for non-technical users (like Facebook and Twitter are).\n\n\nWhat are the top 3 things you would like to communicate through your logo?\nproduct is light-weight, simple, and fun (but not goofy or silly)\n\n\nWhat logo styles do you like (text only, image only, text and image, etc.)?\nI would like an image along with text. The image should be either to the right or left of the text. However, the image element will also be used on its own in some cases, so it should be distinct from the lettering.\n\n\nWhat colors do you want to see in your logo?\nany colors that allude to a clean, simple, light-weight design\n\n\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your logo?\nanything overly heavy, bland, or stodgy\n\n\nWhere will your logo be used (print, website, etc.)?\nLogo will be used on the homepage and the Google Chrome Web Store pages. \nNB: the image element will be used as the icon in the Google Web Store, so please design accordingly. Check out some of the other icons in the web store https://chrome.google.com/webstore\n\n\n\nDo you have other info or links you want to share?\nFor the Google Chrome Web store icon, I will need both a 128x128 pixel version and a 16x16 pixel version. If your vector design retains its distinctiveness and fidelity when scaled down to 16x16 that's preferable, but it is also acceptable to provide a simplified version of the icon appropriate for a 16x16 representation.
