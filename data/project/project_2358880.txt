Aarons Presents will also provide support, communication and resources needed to maximize successful completion of selected proposals.  Each year, grantees will come together for a celebratory event in which each will have an opportunity to speak publicly about his/her present to the world.  Guidance and mentoring will also be provided for this important component of the program.  In addition to the cumulative impact of the projects that are completed each year, after completing the program, an equal number of young people will emerge more engaged, inspired, thoughtful and proactive members of their communities.\r\n\r\nThere is a double meaning in the name.  Each project completed by grant recipients can be viewed as little presents that Aaron has given to the world.  In addition, Aarons presence continues to be felt, as it inspired the organization as a whole, will inspire the children who submit proposals, and will touch others who are affected in a positive way by each completed project.","legacy_brief_sections":[{"questions":[{"legacy_domid":"id_logo_exact_name","value":"Aaron's Presents","name":"logo_exact_name","legacy_field_id":765463,"label":"What is the exact name you would like in your logo?"},{"legacy_domid":"id_your_industry","value":"Other","name":"your_industry","legacy_field_id":765464,"label":"What is your industry?"},{"legacy_domid":"id_logo_top_communicate","value":"Childlike creativity and fun (\"presents\" to the world and unique \"presence\" in the world)\nCommunity engagement\nKindness and compassion","name":"logo_top_communicate","legacy_field_id":765465,"label":"What are the top 3 things you would like to communicate through your logo?"},{"legacy_domid":"id_what_logo_styles","value":"Image + text; simple; modern; clear with or without color; not cluttered; image that's not too literally drawn (e.g., it seems appropriate that the image of a \"present\" would be a part of the logo, but I would want it to be used more abstractly)\n \nSome logos I like: communitythreadmn.org, operationsmile.org, annas-angels.org, nerdwallet.com, harlemchildrenszone.org, sunshinechildrenshome.org, www.horizonsforhomelesschildren.org","name":"what_logo_styles","legacy_field_id":765466,"label":"What logo styles do you like (image + text, image only, text only, etc.)"},{"legacy_domid":"id_logo_info_share","value":"Background info: Aaron Makaio Schneider was born on June 19, 2013 at 25  weeks of gestation and lived 8  days in two Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) in Boston, Massachusetts.
