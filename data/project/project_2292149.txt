We want our benefactors as well as our beneficiaries to know that:\n\n* We are dedicated to helping disadvantaged children achieve their long-term dreams through quality education\n\n* We are a quality organization that works efficiently and effectively\n\n* We can accomplish what our school systems try, but fail to accomplish - equal opportunity for quality education\n\nWhat does it boil down to? Dedication, effectiveness, and hope.\n\n\nWhat logo styles do you like (text only, image only, text and image, etc.)?\nOur logo must include our name, though image inclusion would be nice. We love the clean cut, bold style of http://wwf.panda.org, and are building a website similar to theirs. A logo along those lines (clean cut, grabs your attention), would be great.\n\n\nWhat colors do you want to see in your logo?\nSurprise us. \n\n\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your logo?\nSee above.\n\n\nWhere will your logo be used (print, website, etc.)?\nOur logo will be used on our website, letterhead, etc. \n\n\nDo you have other info or links you want to share?\nWe have uploaded our current logo. It definitely gets across the goal of our organization, but it does not stand out the way we would like. We want to be seen as modern and effective - changing the world. \n\nPlease do not use our current logo as a suggestion for your work - we are not looking for something very similar or completely different.
