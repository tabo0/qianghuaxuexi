(PMI) www.promotion1.com was founded 14 years ago to provide experiential marketing services to clients. (the descriptor for our segment of marketing is experiential. Its the industry standard for defining face-to-face, mobile marketing, guerilla marketing, street teams, sampling, etc.) When founded, PMI was an innovator with very few competitors and lots of room to serve clients needs. Over the years the field has become crowded with both new competitors and those companies that have adjusted their businesses to accommodate experiential marketing in their offerings.\r\n\r\nWe're looking for the magic bullet of logos that makes every one of our competitors wish they had our mark. This new identity will enable PMI to continue it's rapid growth into the future.","legacy_brief_text":"LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT US:\r\n\r\nPMI clients include CNN, Disney, Bosch, Campells, Anheuser-Busch, New York Lottery, Black & Decker etc.. We are known for our exceptional delivery of programs in every aspect of the project  from the field ambassadors we hire to the vehicles we manage, to the training and the face-to-face interaction and final results. \r\n\r\nPMI enables brands and agencies to bring their marketing strategies directly to the desired target market. Its not about vehicles or inflatables, its about results from engaging consumers face-to-face and leaving them with a high level of enthusiasm for our clients brand.\r\n\r\nPMI has repeatedly been named one of the best companies in St. Louis to work for as well as being included in the top 100 Promotion Agencies in the U.S. The founder has been named to the top ten bosses lists repeatedly and is recognized as a proactive and engaging leader.\r\n\r\nPMI has a very strong and spirited culture that is focused on making its clients heros. Each person in PMI has an entrepreneurial spirit that is contagious and empowering. PMI has five core values that are the foundation for everything we do. They are  Employees First Always, Work as a Team Win as a Team, Make It Happen, Reputation Before Revenue and Commitment to Safety.\r\n\r\nPMI has had the current identity for the past 8 years and is ready to move to a new mark and tag line to represent the company. The new tag line is Unbounded Enthusiasm  the rational for this tag line clearly exhibits the true character of Pro Motion in that we live for our clients brands. We are unabashedly proud of our client brands and the work we do for them.\r\n\r\nPro Motion Inc.\r\n\r\nHERE IS WHAT WE NEED:\r\n\r\nThis identity will be very visible on all of our marketing materials and will be first seen on our new web site that is currently in early stages of development. We are a pro-active and fire-up company made up of really great people. This mark needs to have fun, spirit, strength and unbounded enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n!  Current tag line is Unbounded Enthusiasm\r\n!  New mark must be strong, bold, unique, contemporary and energetic\r\n!  New mark must have energy\r\n!  The exclamation mark is an icon that has come to represent Pro Motion and must \r\n   be graphically included in the logo\r\n!  The logo must be able to stand alone and read as Pro Motion\r\n!  \"Pro Motion\" is two words and is not \"Promotion\"\r\n!  Explore the concept of face-to-face marketing, motion and experiences\r\n!  Yellow and blue are the past company colors, explore new color combinations\r\n!  Must compete well with the other experiential logos\r\n!  Mark must work well on-line, in full color and in single color applications\r\n!  Explore business card, letterhead and envelope sticker applications\r\n!  Logo should be dynamic and strong\r\n!  The logo must be extendable to many media and applications & work well in \r\n    many different environments\r\n!  Consider how this new mark might have a related letter-mark only PMI\r\n! The logo must work well in full color and as a black and white & reversed out of black\r\n! The logo will be worn on t-shirts, trucks, road cases, projected in presentations, etc.\r\n! \"Inc.\" does not have to be a part of the identity\r\n\r\nWe're looking for the magic bullet of logos that makes every one of our competitors wish they had our mark. \r\n\r\nOUR TARGET AUDIENCE IS:\r\n\r\nMarketing/branding managers, directors and V.P.s as well as advertising and public relations firms. These are people who are making decisions about large experiential marketing programs. They are searching for experts who know what they are doing and have the experience to deliver real results.\r\n\r\nWE LIKE THESE DESIGNS:\r\n\r\nSee attached \"LogosWeLike\" .jpeg file\r\n\r\nWE ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE (or we don't want to see) THIS IN OUR DESIGN:\r\n\r\nAttached please find PMI_competitors files.
