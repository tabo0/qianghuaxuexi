Our focus is on edible gardening which effectively means growing your own food. \nGrow It Local is a celebration of backyard, balcony, community garden and window-sill farmers. An idea to make growing your own food interesting, cool and sexy. Products will be brought to life though a series of thoughtful collaborations with contemporay artists, designers, musicians, athletes and celebrities from different pockets of culture. Celebrities who actively grow their own of course. :)\n\nOur target audience is better defined by common interests than demographics. They are savvy & stylish forward thinking consumers who seek to have fun, live life to the fullest and make a positive contribution to the world we share.  \n\nThey are yogis, meditation enthusiasts, surfers, collectors, skateboarders, art lovers, home chefs, creatives, party people and modern day hippies. They are digitally savvy, fashionable & simply can't survive without music!\n\nExamples of brands, labels & publications they dig include Supreme, Be@rbricks, Girl Skateboards, Huf,  Future Classic and what was Lucky Peach Magazine\n","top_3":"Modern, timeless, creative, classic, cool","vision":"Our vision for the logo is that it'll be a modern take on the traditional garden gnome but more inspired by Be@rbricks than gnomes of the past. Our gnome will eventually be rendered and printed in 3D. It will become a canvas for collaborating creatives, artists and designers. A gnome that looks equally at home outside in the garden as they inside the house as a near art piece.","select_colors":[["f44336","4CAF50","2196F3","FFEB3B","673AB7","FF9800","00BCD4","795548","777777"]],"how_logo_used":["other"],"select_fonts":["no_preference"],"anything_else":"Please Google 'be@rbricks' then click into 'images'\nFile formats we require include high res .pdf and .eps","industry":"environmental","logo_text":"n/a","create-account":{"email":"darryl@growitlocal.com"},"logo_style":["image_only"]},"brief_questions":[{"description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
