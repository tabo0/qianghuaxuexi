After Grants, Scholarships, and Government Loans there is often still a balance left for students to fund. Its far more financially savvy to take out a loan than it is to raid parents 401k, savings, or credit cards. We are a tech co that provides all functional elements (acquisition, origination, compliance, servicing, insurance) for a financial services lender to offer private student loans. Our main audience are people looking to fund their college education or refinance their existing education loans. For new students, this decision is made by high school seniors and their parents (main decision-maker is their parents). For students currently in school, the decision usually becomes more student-centric, but the parent usually still has to co-sign for the loan). For refinancing consumers, this becomes the decision and audience of an established adult with a good income and a solid credit history (3 years post-college minimum usually with ages from 25-40). We are dedicated to the Future of Student Lending, and proving a way for students to Fund their Future.\n\nThe company name is FUTR (pronounced future).
