Needs to be somewhat understated since we will be using the truck for catering jobs including wedding receptions.\nDon't want a bunch of stock pics of food dishes, flames, or cartoon characters.\nOpen to most colors but it needs to work. But not look like a circus. I Like blues, yellows, greens. Presently we use black & white.\nWrap needs to catch the eye but not be too busy. \n\nSouthern cuisine includes things like fried chicken, collard greens, sweet tea, shrimp & grits, but we also do cajun & creole items like jambalaya, etouffee, which gives us New Orleanss influences. Our BBQ is influenced by Texas, North Carolina, Kansas City, St. Louis & Memphis. \n\nSo I've thought of having a light background image of several states with a marker and city name to show the city/region of influence.  \n\nWe do specialty items, whole BBQ hog, crawfish boils, fish frys, etc. \n\nHave thought of having a bunch of famous food quotes in different sizes and fonts all over the truck. (Will send a list of quotes). Have also thought about doing the same with a list of many of the items we make...not sure about this.\n\nTo the extent possible I want this wrap to convey our love for cooking, passion really, for serving people great food, and seeing them enjoy it feeds our soul. \"\n\nLet us Feed Your Southern Soul\"\n\nI like the following quote in a prominent position on the rear of the truck\n“There is no sincerer love than the love of food.” -George Bernard Shaw","anything_else":"The truck is a 2018 Ford F59. It has not been converted to a food truck yet. The images I am sending are of the base truck. Note the truck we are getting has sedan (swing out) doors and the rear will be reconstructed to have a single door.\n\nOur web address: www.bootheelcatering.com\nWe cater small to large events from back yard BBQ to black tie receptions. \n\nWe also would want our social medi icons, web address, email address and phone number on the truck.\n\nI will ad more detail as it occurs to me or as requested.\n","top_3":"1. Type of Food Southern Cuisine is key. \nSouthern Cuisine, Award Winning BBQ, Cajun & Creole\n2. Fresh Natural Food made with Bold Flavors.\nInterested in conveying that \"southern cuisine\" is also \"soul\" food and \"comfort\" food. \n3. Our love for making & serving great food. Hospitality, charm, \n also people need to know we are a catering company \"let us bring the reastaurant to you!\"","initial_content":"I will upload our logo, pictures of the truck (2018 Ford F59), and pictures of different food trucks noting what I like about their wrap.","company":"We are a full service catering company specializing in  southern cusine. We make all of our rubs, sauces, and dressings from scratch. Our cuisine is never mass produced or frozen. We prepare your menu selections using locally raised, farm fresh and sustainable ingredients creating exceptionally fresh and flavorful food that you will thoroughly enjoy and be proud to serve. \n\nWe take our name from a part of rural Southeast Missouri known as the \"Bootheel\" [boot-heel]. The Missouri Bootheel is the southeastern part of the state where the Missouri border dips down in to Arkansas forming a rectangular-shaped extension that resembles the heel of a boot. Some might say it’s a “panhandle”. \n\nThe Bootheel region is unique!  It brings together the culinary influences not only from Missouri, but those of Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas and even Texas! The Bootheel's proximity to the Mississippi River means that over many years, generations of travelers with diverse cultural backgrounds influenced the region. This created a cultural melting pot that shaped the culinary techniques and flavors of the region. These early travelers and settlers used a variety of farm fresh ingredients and cooking methods that produced incredible food with bold flavors….our food is reflective of this style of fresh and inspiring cuisine.\n\nWe like to say \"Fun Food For Festive Occasions\" and \"BBQ to Black Tie\"!\n\nOur new mobile kitchen(think high end food truck) will be used for daily sales to give us the ability to offer our fresh Southern Cuisine and Award Winning BBQ directly to the public. \n\nWhen appropriate we will also be using the truck as an addition to our catering operation. In this capacity it will be utilized as our onsite kitchen when on a job. \n\nAs a part of our daily operation we will be offering order ahead service via ChowNow to cut the wait times of our customers. We may also utilize UberEats as a delivery source.
