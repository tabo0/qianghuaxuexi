Specialists in AJAX and web 2.0 infrastructure.  We also do visualization and reporting for hedgefunds.\r\n\r\nBodukai -- about the name:\r\n\r\npronounced:\r\nBo = like flow\r\nDu = like Mountain Dew\r\nKai - like \"Guy\" with a K\r\n\r\nThree syllables\r\n\r\nI think emphasis on first syllable\r\n\r\nMight mean a \"daydreamer.\"   But we don't have to stick to that imagery.   I've been investigating possible Chinese characters to represent it, but at this point we're wide open.\r\n\r\nyoung, brash, and expensive  (we're experts.)\r\nconsulting and product development  (advanced AJAX and powerful back-ends.)\r\nmultinational  (ofces in SF and Central America, afliates elsewhere.)\r\ngood guys (we can sleep at night, time permitting.)\r\nOur style:\r\navailable  (we're near the ballpark.)\r\ninformal  (light on process.)\r\nmentoring (we can point you in the\r\nright direction.)\r\nexible (these projects can be\r\nresized if necessary.)\r\ndemanding (work must be good.)\r\nfun (life is short.)\r\n\r\nhttp://bodukai.com/ -- most well known for building the front-end for endless.com  -- see other clients on our home page.\r\n\r\nWe have many products, in many spaces (web search, e-commerce, financial, games, personal management, etc.)\r\n\r\nHere is what we need:\r\nA logo for our company. We like it colorful. A silhouette might be okay or an anthropomorphized animal might work.\r\nAfter this project we will need a new site as well, followed by stationary.\r\nWe are looking for a professional yet edgy logo. Something that lets them people that we are seasoned experts but also gives off an aura of creativity and innovation.\r\n\r\nMaybe a sports metaphor -  The company as the league, the programs as teams in the league?  We're open to this with some caveats.\r\n\r\nPossible Colors:\r\n1. Color palette of Aladdin the Disney movie.  Purple and orange.  Obviously overdone could make us look like a bruised clown.   but done right could be powerful .http://www.flickr.com/photos/83716327@N00/23608688\r\n\r\n2. Denver nuggets colors - http://www.nba.com/nuggets/\r\n\r\n3. KC Royals: http://shop.mlb.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2191278&cp=1452354.1452779.708159\r\n\r\nHere are some color schemes we like as well:\r\nhttp://www.colourlovers.com/palette/560945/cuttin_the_edge?c=1\r\nhttp://www.colourlovers.com/palette/562132/Velocity?c=1\r\nhttp://www.colourlovers.com/palette/556851/cant_go_back?c=1\r\nhttp://www.colourlovers.com/palette/341704/Oppalal%C3%A0?c=1\r\n\r\n\r\nEasily reproduced in black and white.\r\nEasy to read. Easily can be put on a website, printed materials, business cards, etc.\r\nBut we are open to suggestions\r\n\r\nElegant, classy, creative and strong -- all in one.\r\n\r\nOur target audience is:\r\nCompanies looking for Ajax help (i.e. Amazon.com )\r\nSearch companies\r\nData visualization companies\r\nHedgefunds\r\nDefinitely lots of e-commerce companies\r\n\r\nWe like these designs:\r\nhttp://www.reardencommerce.com/\r\n\r\nOur design absolutely must have:\r\nA logo and text. Logo can be a clever merger of the letters \"B\" \"D\" \"K\" (like: http://www.zooyork.com/ )\r\nLogo above the name: (example: http://www.rearden.com/index.html )\r\n\r\nThings we don't like or don't need for this project or other things to avoid using, doing, seeing, etc.\r\nNo images of people.  Not cluttered. \r\nNothing like this:\r\nhttp://www.crowdspring.com/var/crowdspring/storage/images/projects/graphic_design/logo/creative_brief_technical_pro_logo/gallery/soundsphere/image_soundsphere/2147884-1-eng-US/image_soundsphere_submissionlarge.png","legacy_brief_sections":[]},"brief_questions":[{"help":"","label":"Summarize your project.","answer_label":"Project Summary","name":"description","type":"textarea","validations":["required"],"description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
