Do not want it to be cartoony, the logo should appeal to adults as well but target market is definitely 12-20 year old.

Keep the \"HOCKEY PLAYER TOUGH\" verbiage about the same size and below. Font could have a grungy feel to it, like Tool Shed (see example attached). \r\n- The entire logo should be placed within a badge, can be any shape badge (circle, rectangle, square, etc.).

Prefer the background colour of the badge be green or blue.\r\n- The logo can be full colour but would like to see blues and greens incorporated.","description":null,"legacy_brief_sections":[{"questions":[{"legacy_domid":"id_logo_exact_name","value":"Hockey Player Tough","label":"What is the exact name you would like in your logo?","legacy_field_id":1268857,"name":"logo_exact_name"},{"legacy_domid":"id_your_industry","value":"Entertainment and Sports","label":"What is your industry?","legacy_field_id":1268858,"name":"your_industry"},{"legacy_domid":"id_logo_top_communicate","value":"- strength\n- pride\n- persistence","label":"What are the top 3 things you would like to communicate through your logo?","legacy_field_id":1268859,"name":"logo_top_communicate"},{"legacy_domid":"id_what_logo_styles","value":"Attached is a sketch of the logo we want to create.
