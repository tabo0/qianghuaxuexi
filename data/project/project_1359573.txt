The organization reflects the collective desire of multi-disciplinary leaders to promote technological innovation and social advancement, by taking decisive action to maintain the integrity of the patent system (and when appropriate, taking action to change the system).  \r\n\r\nUnlike anything before it, Patenull plans to achieve global benefits for humanity by operating within the seemingly narrow field of patents.  History and research shows that all aspects of human development and social advancement depend on the continuous expression and expansion of human creativity.  The patent system plays a critical role in the way social and environmental systems interrelate and allow humanity to express its creativity.\r\n\r\nWe are motivated to serve the public good, and expressly reject being constrained by partisan ideologies and special interests.  Every aspect of our operation will convey honesty and integrity, and a deep respect for the power of human creativity.  \r\n \r\n\r\nHERE IS WHAT WE NEED:\r\n\r\nWe need a visual identity that reflects our core values and purposes.  We are eager to receive the thoughtful and creative input of the www.crowdspring.community.  At this time, we have no logo, no letterhead/stationary, no business cards, no website, etc.  Whatever we receive from the talented folks here at CrowdSpring will be used for those purposes.\r\n\r\nWe would love an identity that reflects creativity, professionalism, and integrity.  The name \"Patenull\" was inspired by the combination of the words \"Patent\" and \"Null,\" where the word \"null\" means void, and the combination \"Patenull\" suggests a focus on the social injustices associated with void or invalid patents.  We have an open mind towards designs that can convey this and our overall purposes/goals (as explained above).  \r\n\r\nOUR TARGET AUDIENCE IS:\r\n\r\nTechnology companies, universities, patent attorneys, entrepreneurs/inventors.\r\n\r\nWE LIKE THESE DESIGNS:\r\n\r\nWe do not want to sway you towards any particular designs.\r\n\r\nWE ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE (or we don't want to see) THIS IN OUR DESIGN:\r\n\r\nCreative expression and a lack of inhibition.  We respect your artistic ability and talent, and because we lack those qualities, we do not want to place any restrictions on you.  Rather, we hope you will sense our intentions and attitudes, and choose to contribute your energies towards our project in a manner that feels right.\r\n\r\nFinally, in advance, we want to express our sincere gratitude to each individual who contributes ideas for our project.  We wish we could compensate each person for their time, but hope that each person will at least find satisfaction in knowing that their efforts are appreciated and supporting a good social cause.","legacy_brief_sections":[],"description":null},"brief_questions":[{"validations":["required"],"help":"","label":"Summarize your project.","name":"description","type":"textarea","answer_label":"Project Summary","description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
