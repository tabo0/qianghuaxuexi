The concept is based upon a motorised sanding machine with replaceable sanding belts, allowing for different grades of sanding to be done:\n\n1. The knife sharpener should have a motor attached to the sanding mechanism, which could possibly detach and attach for use with a common household drill as the driveshaft.\n\n2. The knife sharpener should have an adjustable speed knob for versatility, and an ability to remain on once switched on. \n\n3. It should have a mounted knife guide attached, allowing for the knife or tool to be inserted from either lateral direction- meaning the sanding belt will run the same direction against both sides of the knife. This should extend a few centimetres further than the belt to prevent the tool falling off the guide.\n\n4. This knife guide needs to have an adjustable angle feature, meaning that the angle of sharpening against the sanding belt can be locked in place to achieve certain angles of cut/sharpening for different sized tools. \n\n5. The guide should have a covering of felt or similarly soft material, so that the back of the knife isn’t damaged while the front edge is being sharpened. At the same time, it needs to have functionality which won’t hinder the sharpening process.\n\n6. The knife sharpener should be designed in such a way that the belt won’t move when the knife is pressed against it, as this will cause an altered angle to the sharpening process, and will ultimately dull the edge trying to be sharpened. \n\n7. Competitor products tend to ‘round the tip of the knife’ due to the sanding belt conforming around the point of the knife. We need to have a method to prevent this.\n\n8. The process of adding and removing sanding belts which need to be changed, due to wear or adjusting to a different grade of coarseness, should be simplistic and quick without affecting the integrity of the machine and sharpening process.\n\n9. It should be designed in such a way that shavings won’t fly into the users face, or cause them to breathe in the dust. \t\n\n10. The product should come with a large range of sanding belts of varying coarseness needed for all knives and tools.\n\n11. Competitor sharpeners can scratch along the side of the knife due to poor design. Our design should prevent this.","price":"One time fee.","vision":"We need the product designs follow all the requirements we have for the product as closely as possible.\n\nThe product has to look desirable. The designs have to fit our brand.
