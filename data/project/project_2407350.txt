Text only would be too plain. The logo needs to give multiple messages: (1) brothers need to be incorporated somehow, (2) and airplane or something to do with aviation needs to be incorporated, otherwise nothing would distinguish this as an \"aviation\" business. If you incorporate an airplane into the design, it should be a plane which has the body style of a Cessna Skyhawk. This is a small, single-propeller plane and is the most common plane we use. One thought I had was if you have two brothers standing in front of a runway, with the runway going back to the distance, and the plane flying over them.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have any other info or links you want to share?\r\nWhat we do: We have small aircraft (mainly Cessna C172 Skyhawk model) we rent out as a flight school, we rent these aircraft, and we provide aerial tours. The company is owned by two good friends, the \"flight brothers\". Ever heard of the Wright Brothers? Well, we're \"the Flight brothers\".\r\n\r\nWe're a big fan of the logo which won this contest, for a brewing company: https://logo.designcrowd.com/contest.aspx?id=1559263\r\n\r\nWhat I like about it is it gives a fun outline of the brothers, you can tell they're toasting each other in the logo too. If you could find a way to get the outline of two guys (just two brothers) maybe standing next to a plane, or two brothers with a plane flying over them, and somehow get the company name \"Flight Brothers Aviation\" incorporated, that's along the lines of what we're thinking. Or maybe you come up with another idea which is even better! We also like aviator sunglasses - but that may be too intricate to have on the guys, and if it's just an outline, probably wouldn't be possible.\r\n\r\nSome other things I like about that 4 brothers logo is it would look good as a general logo for a web site, it could be put on shirts, could be put on a number of marketing/promo materials because it isn't too intricate. Of course - this needs to be a unique work, and can't resemble the 4 brothers logo. We're just including that so you know one logo we like.\r\n\r\nOf course - the design doesn't have to be like that, we're open to seeing what you come up with. This is just one logo I liked which I found by doing a search for \"brothers logo\".\r\n\r\nPlease note... we do not want the name completely \"detached\" from the design. It should somehow be \"in there\", like that 4 brothers logo is. I don't like floating text which is separate to the design, for a number of reasons.","legacy_brief_sections":[{"questions":[{"legacy_domid":"id_logo_exact_name","value":"Flight Brothers Aviation","name":"logo_exact_name","legacy_field_id":1252618,"label":"What is the exact name you would like in your logo?"},{"legacy_domid":"id_your_industry","value":"Other","name":"your_industry","legacy_field_id":1252619,"label":"What is your industry?"},{"legacy_domid":"id_logo_top_communicate","value":"We want a modern, masculine, fun logo which features the outline of two guys (the \"brothers\"), and incorporate an aviation theme into it somehow (possibly wings, an airplane silhouette, propeller, etc).","name":"logo_top_communicate","legacy_field_id":1252620,"label":"What are the top 3 things you would like to communicate through your logo?"},{"legacy_domid":"id_what_logo_styles","value":"Image + text would be ideal.
