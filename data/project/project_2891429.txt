Our demographic therefore changes from forum to forum but generally it is senior level decision makers in organisations who are financially able and eager to build new business relationships with others in the industry (e.g. Marketing Directors or Finance Directors).\n\nThe business forums are made up of 40 % one to one meetings and 60% conference programme. They run for 1-2 days at luxury venues in Italy, US, Switzerland and the UK.\n\nONE TO ONE MEETINGS \nThe one to one meetings are between delegates and suppliers. \nDelegates = the buyers. The delegates are decision makers at a Director level. Delegates attend for the high quality of workshops and key note speakers and to discover what is available in the market place. They receive complimentary invites. \nSuppliers = the sellers. The suppliers are the representatives from companies that would like to provide a service or product to the delegates. The suppliers pay to attend the forums for lead generation. Their aim is to meet senior buyers in face to face meetings to create new business opportunities. \nWe preschedule the one to one meetings and allow both the delegates and suppliers to choose who they would like to meet at the forum. We make this process as fair as possible. \n\nCONFERENCE PROGRAMME\nOur conference programmes provide innovative industry insight. \nThey are made up of guest speakers (TED talk style speeches) and smaller seminars and workshops that aim to address and overcome current industry specific issues. \n\nATTENDEE BENEFITS\n•\tDiscover new product and service providers\n•\tEngage with Industry leaders in our conference \n•\tConnect with new industry peers\n•\tObtain professional development credits through our conference programme\n•\tBuild relationships with senior level decision makers \n•\tHave more one-to-one meetings in a shorter amount of time \n•\tKnow who you are meeting and their buying intentions before the Forum \n\n\n  \n\nABOUT US\nWe operate 50 forums a year across UK, US, Switzerland and Italy \nWe have traditionally run all of our forums on cruiseliners.  Cruise ships provide a unique venue that allows people to focus in an environment that is disconnected from the office. The forums on cruise ships run for 3 nights and 2 days. \nHowever, there is a growing demand for 1.5 day events that are more accessible and the lack of reliable wifi onboard the cruiseliners is becoming an increasing issue. \nTherefore, we have just held our last forum onboard a cruiseliner and are now moving all of our forums to venues ‘on land’ at 5 star hotels.  \n\nThis is now an opportunity to re design our logo and standardise this across all four countries. \n\nWHAT WE ARE KNOWN FOR\nBringing together people from the same industry to create a seamless, time efficient experience where they can – \n•\tConnect and engage with industry peers\n•\tDiscover more about their own industry and where it’s heading \n•\tBenchmark existing suppliers and discover new ones \n•\tCreate new opportunities in a cost effective and time efficient manner \n\nWHAT DOES OUR BRAND CURRENTLY STAND FOR\n•\tA reputation for being well established, fair and professional\n•\tA proven track record for organising a large number of forums over 30 years, offering longevity and experience\n•\tHigh quality conference programmes\n•\tA bespoke experience for each attendee – a meeting selection process that allows attendees to choose their meetings and construct a personalised itinerary.\n","top_3":"credible, professional, current","vision":"We organise 50 forums a year in the UK, Italy, Switzerland and the US. Currently, each forum has a different logo. \n\nWe would like to use ONE logo across all events. Possibly a standardised design that can be modifyied slightly for each event. E.g. different colour. \n\nWe would like the logo to look both professional and current. \n\nFor years we have used a cruise ship as the logo because originally all of our forums were held on cruise ships. However, we have just run our last event on a cruise ship and now all of our events will be held at hotels on land. \n\nWe are open to both logo designs that incorperate the cruiseliner history and designs that choose to go down a different path entirely.
