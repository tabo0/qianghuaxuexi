We make both liquid and granular biostimulant formulas that we sell primarily B2B to large commercial farmers both indoor and outdoor as well as municipalities for their urban health landscape programs.  Biostimulants are primarily formulated mixtures of biological or biologically derived fertilizer additives or amendments that are used in crop production or as a turf treatment to enhance plant growth, health and productivity.  Biostimulants are not a fertilizer like Nitrogen, Phosphorus or Potassium, but they make NPK perform at a maximum level while being all-natural and water conservation friendly.  Our formulas are 100% organic, non-toxic and environmentally responsible.  Sterling-Pacific is actually a joint venture between 2 companies- Sterling Agriculture out of Indiana and Pacific Biostimulants out of Southern California.  Sterling Ag has been manufacturing these organic products for the Amish farmers in the Midwest for the last 30 years, but they have joined forces with PacBio to expand their reach, not only West which is the hotbed for organics; but on global level.","select_fonts":["no_preference"],"logo_style":["image_only"],"industry":"agriculture"},"brief_questions":[{"validations":["required"],"help":"","label":"Summarize your project.","name":"description","type":"textarea","answer_label":"Project Summary","description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
