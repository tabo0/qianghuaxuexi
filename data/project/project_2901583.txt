Designers should consider adding depth/3D effect to logo designs","company":"Eris Financial Products has developed and owns several product patents (USPTO registered patents) which are used in the creation of Eris Swap Futures.\n\nExternally we wish to be known as Eris. NOT Eris FP. We currently own and use the URL www.erisfutures.com and our emails are name@erisfutures.com. The purpose of this project is to update our current logo (see www.erisfutures.com) because we are changing from being a futures “exchange” to being a patent licensing and market data service provider. We would like the new image and Eris wording be recognizable with our current logo, but we want this modernized, fresh and new.\n\nDesigners should note that Eris Financial Products has an affiliated company, that will be name “Eris[something]”. This company will continue to be an “exchange”, but for new crypto-currency assets. Its client audience is entirely separate from Eris Financial Products’s clients. This other project is currently undisclosed.\n\nEris Financial Products, known as Eris, licenses its patents to exchanges who then offer their customers Eris Swap Futures. These products are listed futures contracts (financial instruments) denominated in US Dollars, Euros and British Pounds, that reference these currency interest rates and credit indices.\n\nEris Swap Futures contracts are universally accessible, anonymously traded, transparent and liquid financial contracts used for hedging market risks or expressing market views. Traded on a level playing field, Eris Swap Futures are an innovation of traditional over-the-counter swaps, which end-users must trade with banks. Additionally, Eris futures contracts are more cost effective to end-users than traditional bank-intermediated swaps. Eris Swap Futures are listed and trade on several exchanges, principally CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), under licensing agreements between Eris Financial Products and the respective listing exchanges. Eris provides its partner exchanges (CME & ICE) with product and product development expertise, and marketing support and sales assistance.\n\nEris also interacts directly with partner exchange clients, providing these market end-users with Eris product education, to assist them in their use of Eris Swap Futures. Eris also provides award winning market data and analytics services to the marketplace that are used for the valuation of investment portfolios and the management of market risks. \n\nAs owner and licensor of Eris’s patents to partner exchanges, Eris is uniquely not engaged in a commercial relationship with end-users of Eris Swap Futures. However, Eris regards any market participant that is trading or hedging interest rate or credit exposure as its clients. This means any of the following: institutional asset managers, hedge funds, banks, mortgage related companies, real estate investment trusts, and futures trading firms. The US Dollar Eris Swap Futures product is currently the flagship product, and these clients are principally based across the USA, with pockets of concentration in New York, Boston, Washington, Chicago and Los Angeles. But there are Eris end-users and potential Eris end-users in almost every state of the USA, particularly those cities that are regional banking centers, such as Atlanta, Cleveland, St Louis, Cincinnati and San Francisco to name only a few.\n\nEris’s target audience includes: Corporate financial managers and corporate treasurers – mixed female and male, age 30-50, working for banks, mortgage companies and investment companies. Portfolio managers – mixed female and male, aged 25-55, working for asset management firms and hedge funds. Market Traders – predominantly male, age 25-45, some sole proprietors, most working for trading firms.\n\nEris desires to be seen as the following by the market:\nEris - Market innovator, modernizing and democratizing financial markets;\nEris - The better way to trade swaps;\nEris – A simple and easy product to manage risk and express market views;\nEris – A liquid and safe way to manage risk and express market views;\nEris – The dawn of a new way to trade risk more efficiently;\nEris – The standard for interest rate benchmarking;\nEris – I manage risk more efficiently with Eris, and this allows me to grow and be more competitive."},"brief_questions":[{"help":"","type":"textarea","answer_label":"Project Summary","description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
