The front cover “coat of arms” will be reminiscent of the great Dutch painters of old: featuring an original and stunning royal “shield” from the days of knights and medieval heraldry. The power, mood, and lush, saturated colors of this “shield” will feel like the museum works of masters Rembrandt and Jan Davidszoon de Heem (see: “Flowers in a Vase”). Thank you.\n\nThe Front Cover:\n\nThese elements must be included.\n\n1.\tTitle:  EMBLEM AMERICA (on top, very commanding and clean)\n2.\tSubtitle: “The world enters the Promised Millennium. America blazons the way.” \n3.\tThe Shield: (filled tastefully with the American flag; utterly gorgeous, like a museum piece.. resembling fine art)\n4.  Above the Shield: majestic and serene, the American Eagle (the bird) with long outstretched wings, perched atop, all white, protecting the shield like a descending angel. Slightly mystical.\n5.  Inside the Shield: The Blue Sapphire – On the very bottom of the shield (but inside it), there is a multi-faceted, luminescent, blue  sapphire gem, sparkling and radiant! \n6.\tThe Motto below the Shield reads: “Faith” “Nobility” “Christ Destiny”.. in the style of medieval heraldry\n7.  Author’s Name: Michael An’gileo \n8.\tBelow: “100% of author royalties from Emblem America are donated to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital”\n9.\tBelow: “American Elegant Publications”\n\nSPECIAL NOTES: (1) The American Flag, which fills the shield, should feature the “Old Glory” colors, more sumptuously, like the old American flag from the Napoleonic Era, circa 1800. (2) The Motto must contain these 3 statements in order (left to right).. FAITH / NOBILITY / CHRIST DESTINY. Because NOBILITY is in the middle, it should sit directly under the blue sapphire gem of the shield. (3) PLEASE check the createspace.com specifications for book-cover design instructions, and use the maximum DPI possible. I need a very high resolution cover. This is important.\n\nThe Back Cover:\n______________________________________________________\n(Actual Text)\n\nThe Gift.\n\nYou have received EMBLEM AMERICA today because of your extraordinary demonstration of faith and your love for America. Michael An’gileo is reaching out to the hearts of millions to share the prophetic signs and wonders regarding America’s sparkling future and the details of an epochal shift for governments everywhere—a promised Global Renaissance.\n\nNever has a book been written that so succinctly details America’s current place on God’s Royal Timeline and the 7th Millennium threshold eluded to in the Christian Bible and echoed in the Jewish Talmud. America’s future is far brighter than anyone could possibly imagine.\n\nIn the end, the majesty and return of the King Messiah the Water Bearer gloriously emerges, as does a stunning New Era of Faith, Nobility and Christ Destiny for the world.\n\nMICHAEL AN’GILEO is dedicated to bringing the gifts of faith and nobility, and the blazoning of a symbolic shield for America and its friends, to a world in need of answers. Emblem America breathtakingly points to a most Noble and Elegant Destiny for the United States of America, written with An’gileo’s signature passion and grace. \n\nBorn in Kenmore, New York, Michael An’gileo graduated from the University of Southern California and currently teaches English and ESL Writing courses in Los Angeles. \n\nAuthor Photo:  OPEN PICTURE FRAME (will supply photo soon)\n\nBook Cover Design by (your name here)\nAuthor photo by Linda Vanoff \n\nBar Code:  LEAVE OPEN FRAME\n\n\n*Additional Requirement:\n\n1.\tI will need a separate file solely of the emblem “shield” itself in black and white, to insert into the book.
