They are not necessarily super athletic and not necessarily interested in the competitive element of sports/running based on speed or distance. They do on the other hand like to be creative, discover and play. \nMan and woman in the possession of a smartphone. They are media literate and have adopted the use of applications and social media, like facebook, in their life. Not only the geeks. Just people who like to be in contact with peers and share their experiences and thoughts online. \nAge 16-65. Middle class. We aim at a global reach through either the smartphone app or the website. Values and interests: Health, Connectedness, Happiness.\n\n\n\nWhat are the top 3 things you would like to communicate through your logo?\n\tPlay\n\tDiscover\n\tFit\n\n\n\nWhat logo styles do you like (text only, image only, text and image, etc.)?\nLogos with a strong and simple image. An image that is very recognizable and stands out. Also when it is shown at the size of an app icon on a smartphone. Bright colours. Not too much detail. The logo should be visually in balance when used with but also when used without the word Figurerunning. So for example in my email signature and on the website I use it with the word, but as an app Icon or on small merchandise it can be used without the word.\n\nGood examples:\n-\tEvernote http://evernote.com/ \n-\tFoursquare icon: http://foursquare.com/\n-\tLayar: http://www.layar.com/\n-\tTwitter http://twitter.com/\n-\tShazam http://www.shazam.com/ \n\n\n\nWhat colors do you want to see in your logo?\nWe are open for any advice on colors since this is the first design element of our brand and we do not have a color palette yet.\n\n\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your logo?\nThere are no colors that are not allowed. But the main color should not be blue or red. Of course they can be sub colors.\n\n\nWhere will your logo be used (print, website, etc.)?\nOnline: website, profile pics of things like facebook, twitter etc.\nMobile: the applications icon on a phone.\nPrint: on merchandise like hoodies, shirts, caps and sweatbands etc.\n\n\n\nDo you have other info or links you want to share?\nEverybody loves playing outside. Figurerunning is a new sport that encourages you to get creative, go outside and discover new places while running and getting fit. The competition is not about your running speed or distance, its all about drawing. Become a master in the art of Figurerunning. Do it when and wherever you want and be sure to share your art with your friends.
