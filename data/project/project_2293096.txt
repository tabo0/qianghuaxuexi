Ltd.\n\n\nWhat is the exact name you would like in your logo?\nDobsoft Studios\n\n\nWhat is your industry?\nVideo game industry\n\n\nDescribe the target audience for your logo\nThe target audience is people that enjoy playing games. We are targetting mobile phone devices first and so this may include a lot of people that wouldn't normally play games/or play on consoles. Therefore we'd like a logo that appeals to as many people as possible through an attractive graphic and a good feeling of the fun that will be had playing our games.\n\n\nWhat are the top 3 things you would like to communicate through your logo?\n1) A sense of fun\n2) A sense of quality\n3) A uniqueness\n\n\nWhat logo styles do you like (text only, image only, text and image, etc.)?\nWe are looking for both text and image, similar to what has been entered for this project:\n\nhttp://www.crowdspring.com/project/2292545_spy-toy-warehouse-logo/\n\n\nWhat colors do you want to see in your logo?\nOpen to any creative ideas here. The plan at the moment is to have the logo used against a black background at the startup of each of our games, but this could change if the winning design looks better another way.\n\n\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your logo?\nWhile we would like to see some good use of color in the logo, we don't want it to incorporate too many colors all at once to give it that \"kids\" sort of look. Kids will only be part of our market and we want the logo to appeal to as many groups of game-players as possible.\n\n\nWhere will your logo be used (print, website, etc.)?\nPrimarily in games (mobile phone games for now) and also on the company website. There may be need for it to be used in print in the future, but it is not the priority.\n\n\nDo you have other info or links you want to share?\nHere are a few screenshots of our upcoming game. These give you an idea of our style but should not be TOO influential on your designs, because the genre of titles may change dramatically between games.\n\nhttp://dobsoftstudios.com/web_images/bsnewtitle_resized.jpg\n\nhttp://dobsoftstudios.com/web_images/bsnewgameplay_resized.jpg","legacy_brief_sections":[{"questions":[{"legacy_domid":"id_business_name","value":"Dobsoft Studios Pty.
