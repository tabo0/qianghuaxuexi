Like a glass bubble it looks beautiful suspended from fishing wire and even better once you place a lit tealight candle inside.  Simple and elegant in design they look great clustered together as a light installation, hanging from trees in the garden, for christmas, for weddings, the list goes on and on.  \r\n\r\nWe have an idea that this whirlybub has a real personality: it's good looking and it knows it, but it is so cute and charming you can't help loving it!  \r\n\r\nHERE IS WHAT WE NEED:\r\n\r\nWe want a simple illustration to go on our website and marketing material of our new whirlybub character.  We want the shape of the actual product to feature as part of the character and imagine the best way is to have the head in the shape of the tealight holder.  The illustration must show the hole at the front of the holder and the closed loop on top of the holder.  As this holder will most commonly be used with fishing wire through the loop at the top and with a tealight inside, featuring these somehow in the illustration would probably work well to make clear its purpose.\r\n\r\nIn our heads, the holder is like an astronaut's helmet with the eyes etc visible through the hole in the front.  The holder/head is the focus so should be oversized with the rest of the body less important.  These are just ideas - we are open-minded to better ones.\r\n\r\nShowing us how you would copy the style of your character in the lettering of \"whirlybub\" would be great.  We like the idea of the \"i\" having a flame instead of a dot.\r\n\r\nPlease see the attached files for close ups of the product from different angles.  On the top of the whirlybub are two small holes.  These should appear in the illustration but shouldn't be a main feature.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR TARGET AUDIENCE IS:\r\n\r\nLets face it, the average guy does not spend a lot of time thinking about candle holders so our target audience is women.  We want to convey that the whirlybub is fun but above all that it is versatile, stylish and eye-catching.  \r\n\r\nWE LIKE THESE DESIGNS:\r\n\r\nWe like the mazuma character.\r\nWe like the idea of this illustration in just one or two colours.\r\nWe like the idea of this character as a simple cartoon-style line drawing.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE (or we don't want to see) THIS IN OUR DESIGN:\r\n\r\nMust have the shape of the holder.\r\nMust design lettering for \"whirlybub\" to go alongside the illustration."},"brief_questions":[{"validations":["required"],"label":"Summarize your project.","type":"textarea","description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
