Primarily I manage twitter and facebook pages for businesses. Other services include customisation of facebook, google places, youtube, twitter channels, blogging, search engine optimisation and online-based advertising campaigns. \n\n\nWhat is the exact name you would like in your logo?\nSocialites    \n\n\nYou'll receive designs for biz cards, letterhead and envelopes.\nI do NOT NEED an envelope design.\n\nLogo:\nThe logo must be able to work on Web and Print - can be two versions, e.g. reversed out version for web. So vertical and square (for web) required.\n\nBiz card details to include:\nname, email, address, web, twitter and facebook accounts\n\nLetterhead versions needed:\n1. Plain letterhead: to also include these contact details - email, web, address.\n\n2. Letterhead Quote header to also include a DATE field\n\n3. Letterhead Invoice header to include above plus GST #  and an INVOICE NUMBER field.\n\n\nWhat is your industry?\nSocial media, advertising.\n\n\nDescribe the target audience for your logo and stationery\nThe target audience is primarily small to medium-sized business owners or mid-level marketing execs. The owners are involved in the day-to-day running of their businesses. They are not very familiar with the area that Socialites works in being social media. However they have heard of it and know they should be using it. The mid-level marketing execs want to use social media for a campaign but need to outsource it to safe hands.\n\nThey are a 50/50 gender mix, late 30s to early 60s who are familiar with business and corporate life. \n\n\n\nWhat 3 things would you like to communicate to your audience through your logo and stationery?\nProfessional - so a clever clean design is important.\nChic - as above, I don't want to just 'choose a font'.\nIntelligent - in a 2010s way, not 1960s way!\n\n\n\nWhat logo and stationery styles do you like (text only, image only, text and image, etc.)?\nI definately want more than just Socialites in a fancy font. Either an avatar as part of the logo or using the letters in a clever way is mandatory.\n\nThe online logo needs to work well as a small square - as it will be the image used as an avatar on facebook, twitter etc.\n\n\nWhat colors do you want to see in your logo and stationery?\nI do like blues, the colour of communication - but don't let that restrict you. Especially as the Socialites logo will often be linked to existing social media logos like facebook, twitter etc it needs to complement them and stand out over them so blue possibly won't work!\n\n\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your logo and stationery?\nMy previous biz partner created a logo using grey and white with orange accents - so need to stay clear of those. See socialites.co.nz so you can see what to avoid.\n\n\nWhat adjectives should best describe your logo and stationery?\nModern. Chic. Professional.\n\n\nWhere will your logo be used (print, website, etc.)?\nThe logo must stand-out online.\nIt must look fabulous as an avator - ie. as a twitter/facebook/blogging profile box.\nIf necessary the business card/stationary version can be simpler by being reversed out etc.\n\n\nDo you have additional info or links you want to share?\nHave fun! an online brand is a little harder to crack because it does have to work small and square. But there are so many bad ones out there that a good design really stands out.\n\nJust to let you know a little about me as design can be subjective, my background is in advertising and entrepreneurship. I'm a girly-girl who loves Alannah Hill, pencil skirts and high heels! I am well known for being ridiculously organised and reliable. Being from an ad background I really do know and appreciate good design and because this I know I'm not the best person to create this design!\n\nSo, in my logo I'm looking to convey polish, professionalism with a modern 2010s feel.\n\nHope this helps.
