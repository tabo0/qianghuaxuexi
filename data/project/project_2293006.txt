Many have houses that are 40+ years old and want to update them.  Many of the decision makers are women. People willing to pay for intellectual remodeling, innovative products, green products.  Willing to look long-term in respect to energy efficient products. I want it to attract the audience from young couples with money to renovate for long term living and energy savings to older ppl who want to age in their home but looking for contractors who will really listen to their needs. Attract females more than males is probably more important since they tend to be the decision makers. Sometime that screams trust & quality. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the top 3 things you would like to communicate through your logo?\r\nWe are not the typical \"good ole boy\" contracting firm. (In fact we are woman owned).  We are very organized with great service and quality.  We want to be perceived as:\r\n1. current, up to date, well read on new products\r\n2. environmentally, socially conscious\r\n3. not the cheapest contractor out there, therefore don't want to deter phone calls from price shoppers. \r\n4. thorough in how we tackle projects.  we wont be the most expensive either bc we're not a designer, but we are more like \"smart remodelers/builders\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat logo styles do you like (text only, image only, text and image, etc.)?\r\nWe currently use just text and would like an image/logo.  Combined with text to establish a recognizable brand but the text and logo need not be connected so if name gets change, it can carry over. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat colors do you want to see in your logo?\r\nopen to most colors. warm & trusting color. memorable, set apart from the rest. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your logo?\r\nfire engine red and dark blue. NO typical hardhat, bulldozer and hammer pics. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhere will your logo be used (print, website, etc.)?\r\nLogo will be used on website and signs on properties we work on.  Print materials will be developed later using Crowdspring.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have other info or links you want to share?\r\nWe have mostly working on kitchens & bathrooms renovations.  Within the last 2 years have increased our \"additions\" production.  Most contracting firms are selected by the woman of the house for the type of remodeling we do.  Colors and designs should reflect that audience.  I really want a logo that will express a sense of  style, quality and smarts but not getting into looking we we're a design firm. I want it to say construction without being cliche and predictable.","legacy_brief_sections":[{"name":"Business Info","questions":[{"name":"Business Name","legacy_field_id":118998,"value":"Chasemetro Construction Corp [dba,doing business as, Chase Construction]","label":"Business Name","legacy_domid":"id_business_name"},{"name":"What is the exact name you would like in your logo?","legacy_field_id":118999,"value":"Chase Construction (am open to derivations of the name)","label":"What is the exact name you would like in your logo?","legacy_domid":"id_exact_name_in_logo"}],"label":"Business Info","legacy_field_id":118997},{"name":"Target Audience","questions":[{"name":"What is your industry?","legacy_field_id":119001,"value":"General Contractor, Construction, Remodel, Custom Home Build, Residential Renovations","label":"What is your industry?","legacy_domid":"id_your_industry"},{"name":"Describe the target audience for your logo","legacy_field_id":119002,"value":"Homeowners, ages 30+, in the Metro Washington DC area who have disposable income.
