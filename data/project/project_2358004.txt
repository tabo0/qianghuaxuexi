Many or our customers and prospects have been used to having a number of smaller independent IT systems to support their business meaning that the users often had to jump between different systems with different behaviors and also had to type in the same information in several places. In order to make better solutions for the users, these stand- alone systems have been service enabled and integrated, i.e. a layer have been put on top of all of them, so, viewed from the outside, it is only one system with a common behavior. \r\n\r\nThis brings os to the problem. If one of the independent system fails you can still work on the others, but when you integrate everything, the risk of everything failing if just  small piece fails is very high and that can bring your whole business to a halt.\r\n\r\nWe would like to illustrate that vulnerability using houses of cards. \r\n\r\n1. Using the house of cards metaphor should illustrate vulnerability\r\n2. Small houses of cards are easy to build and repair, large ones are not \r\n3. Removing only one card will make everything collapse, no matte the size\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat lillustration styles do you like?\r\nWe would like to have a 3D style house of cards in different sizes. \r\n\r\nIntependent systems:\r\nSmall ones, e.g. 3 stories high, that illustrates individual systems. It should be possible to change the colour of the back of the cards to illustrate different systems. We also need illustrations where you can see one card being removed and another one where the house of cards have collapsed. \r\n\r\nIntegrated systems:\r\nThe large house of cards where the independent systems form above, are at the bottom and the integration layers are built on top. It should be possible to change the colours of the back of the cards to illustrate which system it belongs to. We also need the traw \"lines\" between the stories of the house of cards to illustrate the technical layers in the system. Here we also need illustrations where you can see one card being removed and another one where the house of cards have collapsed. \r\n\r\nIf possible.
