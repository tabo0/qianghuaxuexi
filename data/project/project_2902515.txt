Functionality is important to them.  For example, instead of a regular carry on, they would get an AWAY carry on because they can charge their battery with it. \n\nThey're loyal to brands that are easy to navigate and are not too expensive. \n\nFavorite brands are: Everlane, Glossier, Harry's, Muji and Vrai & Oro. \n\n","purpose":"They make it easier for pet owners to spend more time with their dogs without worrying about the little annoying things that come with owning a pet. \n\nYou have the option to design a dog harness, leash, bed or travel bag (you can also do more than one). \n\nThe goal is to think beyond the aesthetic. \nIf its a leash for example,  what would it offer that makes it an \"improved\" version of what's out in the market?
