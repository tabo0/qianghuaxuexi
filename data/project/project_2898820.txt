As a new product, logo should telegraph the basic deliverable.  Some thought should be given to the likelihood that this logo will be used on the plastic case of the product.  Finally, not sure if/how this would be incorporated, but with increasing privacy concerns, security is also a factor of interest.","company":"The company, Watchanator, makes products that continuously track and record performance of cable companies and Internet Service Providers (ISPs), to put information, and more power, into the hands of consumers, who have been taken advantage of.  These products facilitate getting relief from these vendors in the event of poor performance.\n-\tThere is continuing dissatisfaction among Internet and Cable TV subscribers regarding the quality of delivered service.  Prices keep going up, but the individual consumer is limited in his/ her power to get satisfaction or lodge a complaint - - and just the process of making a phone call is torture.\n-\tWatchanator uses patented frame-grabbing technology to continuously monitor all subscribed cable channels 24/7/365, whether it’s a major channel in prime time, or an obscure channel at 3am.  Watchanator delivers detailed reports regarding delivery outages or downtimes, by channel, by time of day and duration.  These reports serve as powerful substantiation for consumers seeking remedies, and balance the playing field by putting information in the hands of the consumer.  Watchanator is targeted for launch in early 2019.\no\tNetWatchanator is a companion to Watchanator - - it monitors the incoming internet signal and continuously records download and upload speed and any outages.  When there is an outage or severe slowdown, it sends an automatic notice to the person’s ISP.  The difference between NetWatchanator and other online speed measurement or downtime sites is: 1) NetWatchanator accurately records exact time, date and duration of downtimes – which speed monitoring sites cannot do; 2) NetWatchanator is based on actual incoming signals; competing downtime sites are based on second-hand monitoring of social media activity; 3) NetWatchanator provides accurate historical reports to record performance over time; speed measurement sites generally show just a snapshot and 4) NetWatchanator has the ability to automatically notify the ISP of a problem.  NetWatchanator is targeted for launch in 4Q 2018.\no\tNetWatchanator is delivered as a small, highly secure and encrypted box (about the size and dimensions of an Apple TV box), as well as software.  It will retail in the neighborhood of a one-time charge of $49.\n-\tThe demographic target for both of these products is not exactly known, but seems to skew a bit toward age 35-55, with a little more than average technical capability.  Younger consumers are skeptical; older ones intimidated."},"brief_questions":[{"help":"","type":"textarea","answer_label":"Project Summary","description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
