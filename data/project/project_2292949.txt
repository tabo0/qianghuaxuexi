Then we want to convey authoritative, international in scope and coverage, modern, professional, business-to-business\n\n\nWhat print design styles do you like?\nSee http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/features/list and http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/Reports for examples of what we are currently doing. We want standard branding identity for each of our three reports that incorporate either our name or our logo (attached). Brands that we like are The Economist, Foreign Affairs magazine.\n\n\nWhat colors do you want to see in your print design?\nPlease use combinations of our branded colors:\n\nBlack\nWPR logo orange (R = 246, G=174, B=38)\nBlue (9FC4F8)\nLight Gray (837D75)\nDark Gray (414158)\n\n\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your print design?\nPlease ONLY use the colors listed above. \n\n\nWhat adjectives should best describe your print design?\nMost importantly the 3 templates should clearly brand and distinguish between a Feature Report, Special Report and Strategic Posture Review. We want to establish separate, recognizable identities for each type of report. The templates should be professional, international, authoritative, serious.\n\n\nHow will you use the print design?\nWe want three different templates for three different reports. WE DO NOT WANT COVER ART - just brand identity elements that will remain constant, but that separately identify the three types of reports - Features, Special Reports, and Strategic Posture Reviews. Right now we use a black bar across the top for Features and Strategic Posture Reviews, and large \"WPR\" across the top for Special Reports. We would like something better for each that incorporates either our name or our logo (attached).\n\nWe will then overlay your template on top of the cover art for each week's report. PLEASE MAKE SURE THE TEMPLATES ARE EITHER IN INDESIGN, PHOTOSHOP OR ILLUSTRATOR. Ultimately they will go into the final indesign file.\n\n\nWhat content must be included in the print design?\nYou must include either our logo (attached), our name \"World Politics Review\" or \"WPR\" in each of the three templates. You must also include the words \"Feature Report,\" \"Special Report,\" or \"Strategic Posture Review\" on each template. There should also be a place for the date of each publication. I have uploaded the covers of each type of report to give you an idea of what we currently do.
