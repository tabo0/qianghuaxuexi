They yearn for: Become rich & famous - Moving up the social hierarchy - Being more confident in their skin - Feeling more unique (internally & externally). Worldviews: Pessimistic - Hedonistic - Selfish - Not politically opinionated.\n\n2- Intellectuals. What they consume is routed in reason & hollistic Value (time saved, benefits, price signal, quality). They fear: Being inconsistent or seeming stupid - not fulfilling their life's purpose/dreams - The unfolding of a dim future - Not getting their version of a deal - PUSH Advertising - Wasting Time. They yearn for: Becoming wealthy - a life of fulfilment & abundance - Great service.  Worldviews: Optimists - Skeptics - Self-less - Libertarian.\n","select_fonts":["mono","serif"],"select_colors":[["f44336","4CAF50","2196F3","FFEB3B","673AB7","FF9800","00BCD4","795548","777777"]],"description":"Packaging design for a new approach to discovering and purchasing fragrances.","industry":"cosmetics-beauty"},"brief_questions":[{"validations":["required"],"help":"","label":"Summarize your project.","name":"description","type":"textarea","answer_label":"Project Summary","description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
