My art is nature inspired and I would like the 'L' of my name to represent 'up-lift', inspiration, freedom and 'transport'. Being that I'm an oil painter, it would be nice to have a logo that looks painted (like a brushstroke) with lines that may change in width.      \n\n\nWhat logo styles do you like (image + text, image only, text only, etc.)\nAnother oil painter's logo I like is on her site: ErinHanson.com She uses her acronyms for her logo.
