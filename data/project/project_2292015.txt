My audience is very aware of trends in fashion and design. I'm based in Los Angeles, but want to reach a bi-coastal and well-traveled clientele.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat 3 things would you like to communicate to your audience through your logo and stationery?\r\n1. Sophisticated and beautiful floral designs.\r\n2. Creative collaboration with clients and strong customer service.\r\n3. Making dreams come to true. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat logo and stationery styles do you like (text only, image only, text and image, etc.)?\r\nhttp://www.amyosaba.com/ I like the round design in her logo. Something round or mandala shape would be great, incorporating \"Noble Four Designs\". Also, one idea is to use one of the \"four noble flowers\" (plum blossom, orchid, bamboo and chrysanthemum), which is the inspiration behind the company name. But these are not givens, I'm open to seeing other ideas. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat colors do you want to see in your logo and stationery?\r\nI'm open to all colors, but I love pinks, celadon (jade), gray, silver, gold, black, white. I'm open to other colors that evoke a subtle Asian feel.  \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your logo and stationery?\r\nMaybe brown, orange, or blue. I think red is too strong and too \"Asian\". \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat adjectives should best describe your logo and stationery?\r\nSensual, Organic, Creative, Iconic. I want something that says this is not your average floral designer. Nothing cute, too pretty, or too flowy. I'm looking for a fine balance between the ying and yang, the feminine and masculine, which I feel is my direction in this kind of business.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere will your logo be used (print, website, etc.)?\r\nWebsite, blog, business cards, and in the future,  packaging. \r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have additional info or links you want to share?\r\nPlease go to my blog www.noblefourcreative.com to see pictures of some of my floral designs and to know a little about my aesthetics.","legacy_brief_sections":[{"label":"Business Info","legacy_field_id":104152,"questions":[{"value":"Noble Four Creative","label":"Business Name","legacy_field_id":104153,"legacy_domid":"id_business_name","name":"Business Name"},{"value":"I specialize in floral design and event styling for weddings, parties, and small corporate events.","label":"What do you do?","legacy_field_id":104154,"legacy_domid":"id_what_do_you_do","name":"What do you do?"},{"value":"Noble Four Designs","label":"What is the exact name you would like in your logo?","legacy_field_id":104155,"legacy_domid":"id_exact_name_in_logo_stationery","name":"What is the exact name you would like in your logo?"},{"value":"This logo and identity style guide will later be used to design my website and collateral such as brochures and post cards.
