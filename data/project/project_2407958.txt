For example, in the Ketchup category, the offering is not just a regular ketchup available with most competition players. Instead the variants come with specialized taste zones of sun dried tomato, barbecue, chilly garlic, etc. Mayonnaise will be flavored like chilly, garlic, black pepper, etc. We want to connote the same message through our brand name - hence, \"Your Hunger Satisfied!\"\n\n\nHow many sides of the package require graphics design?\nWe're inviting concepts which are harmonized across the range of ketchup-mayonnaise-mustard-hot sauce-salad dressing-nuts. You can choose 1 variant per product type to show the concept harmonized along the entire family of YHS. 2 types of packaging depending upon the bottle shape: 1) Wrap-around label + Neck label 2) Front label + Back label + Neck label.
