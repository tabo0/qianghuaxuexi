Some white and other colors.\n\nSecondly, starting with the APIO brand mark, design the word APIOconnect.com and APIO Connect Limited.  If you would like to add graphics to the corporate logo, not the brand logo, that would be okay too. I am open to ideas. APIOconnect.com will be used on our website which sells consumer electronics.\n\n\nWhat colors do you want to see in your logo?\nRed and blue. Although open to all colors.
