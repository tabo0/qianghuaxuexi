Although my customers are mostly age 20-50.  I may expand into children's jewelry and men in the future so I want to keep that open.\n\n\nWhat are the top 3 things you would like to communicate through your logo?\nMy work is handmade but I want customers to know they are getting a professional quality product.  Also, everything is one of a kind.  No two pieces are the exactly the same.  I also do custom work to make jewelry for the customers needs.  What I work with is Precious Metal Clay which is fine silver when it is complete.  I also include gemstones, glass and beads to some of the designs.\n\n\nWhat logo styles do you like (text only, image only, text and image, etc.)?\nI am really open to see what people come up with.  However, I think I would like some sort of image with the text.  Something that can be used alone as well here and there.  \n\n\nWhat colors do you want to see in your logo?\nI am staying open to all color ideas.  My favorite colors are greens, purples and blues.  I also want it to be such that it will look good in black and white as well.\n\n\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your logo?\nThe only color I really don't like is pink.  I won't count it out though, if it helps the design.  But I do not want a purely pink logo. \n\n\nWhere will your logo be used (print, website, etc.)?\nEverywhere.  Currently I sell my work on Etsy but plan to move that to its own site in the future.  Ad banners, print, packaging, etc.\n\n\nDo you have other info or links you want to share?\nHere is the link to my Etsy shop so you can see a few pieces of my jewelry.  \nhttp://www.etsy.com/people/SpiralAmulet?ref=si_pr\nJust the silver pieces.  Pay no attention to the clay beads as that is old work that I am selling to clear inventory.  My focus is moving towards precious metal clay or fine silver jewelry.","description":null,"legacy_brief_sections":[{"questions":[{"legacy_domid":"id_business_name","value":"Spiral Amulet","label":"Business Name","legacy_field_id":129122,"name":"Business Name"},{"legacy_domid":"id_exact_name_in_logo","value":"Spiral Amulet","label":"What is the exact name you would like in your logo?","legacy_field_id":129123,"name":"What is the exact name you would like in your logo?"}],"label":"Business Info","legacy_field_id":129121,"name":"Business Info"},{"questions":[{"legacy_domid":"id_your_industry","value":"Jewelry and crafts","label":"What is your industry?","legacy_field_id":129125,"name":"What is your industry?"},{"legacy_domid":"id_target_audience_logo","value":"I create jewelry for women of all ages.
