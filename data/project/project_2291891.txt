One that conveys a modern, happy individual whom is there to get the job done right!\n\nOur goal is to create a company that provides the quality of service you received in the past (THINK: 1950s gas station service attendants) yet coupled with a systematic pricing program that takes the guess work out of how much our service will cost the consumer.\n\nJust like the image provided as an example, I would like the illustration you create to be black/white (with exception of his hair) and able to be placed on any background color that we see fit.\n\nRegarding the illustrations hair, we want his hair to look like grass, so it obviously needs to be GREEN.  I will leave it up to your own creativity to determine the length of the grass and whether it is wild and crazy or short and well-kept or some variation of the two.\n\nThis caricature/illustration/icon will be used on all our branding, which will include vehicle wraps for our service fleet, print advertising, web marketing, embroidered (and or screen printed) work apparel, etc.\n\nWe know there are incredibly talented artists in this community and are looking forward to seeing your work on this project.  \n\n\n\nWhat lillustration styles do you like?\nSee attached example\n\n\nWhat colors do you want to see in your illustration?\nSee comments above and attached example\n\n\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your illustration?\nSee comments \n\n\nWhat adjectives should best describe your illustration?\nfun, whimsical, nostalgic, clever, hip\n\n\nWhere will you use the illustration (print, website, etc.)?\nvehicle wraps, print, embroidery (if possible), screen print, website\n\n\nDo you have additional info or links you'd like to share?\nI have attached an image similar to the style we are wanting for our own.
