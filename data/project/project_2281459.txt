Think of LinkedIn for events.  Event organizers use this web app to allow event attendees to see who else is coming to the event.  Event attendees can get in touch with one another before, during and after the event.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERE IS WHAT WE NEED:\r\n\r\n3.5 pages:\r\n\r\n1)  \"Event Details\" (see EventDetails file provided for rough guide)\r\n\r\nThis will have:\r\nEvent Name\r\nEvent Date and Time\r\nEvent Location/Address\r\nEvent Description\r\nGoogle Map showing address.\r\nEvent selector (an event attendee may be attending several different events).  \r\nAlso, one or two IAB ad units.  \r\n \r\n2)  \"Attendee List\" (see AttendeeList file provided for rough guide)\r\n\r\nThis will have a list of attendees.  The attendee list will include attendee's picture, name, job title, company, industry as well as one line bio.  Also each attendee is presume to have a LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter account.  These should be represented as well.  \r\n\r\nThe list headers will be sortable and the list will be searchable.  \r\n\r\nAlso, one or two IAB ad units.  \r\n\r\nAlso, there should be a section called \"Event Stats\" -- this will be indicate how many people are attending, how many from X industry etc etc\r\n\r\n3)  \"Messages\" (see Messages file provided for rough guide)\r\n\r\nThis will be simple messaging capability/Inbox.  \r\n\r\nMessage sender name, date and time.  Subject line.  Some main text.  Also, which event the sender attended.  (Event attendees can only send messages to those who attended the same event)  \r\nThere is no IAB ad unit on message page.  \r\n\r\n3.5)  See \"ModalPopup\" When an attendee is clicked upon in the Attendee List, a modal pop-up with more information is shown and the attendee list is greyed out.  The modal pop-up includes attendee's picture, name, job title, company, industry as well as one line bio.  Also links to their LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter accounts. \r\n\r\nAlso, modal pop-up will inform viewer if they are connected/linked to the attendee or share connections on any of the aforementioned social networks.  Also, will include link or form to send a message to the attendee.  \r\n\r\nThere is no IAB ad unit on modal pop-up.  \r\n\r\nOUR TARGET AUDIENCE IS:\r\n\r\nOur target audience is business people attending events such as tradeshows and conferences in order to network and meet people.  Typography should be large and easy to read, as well as simple and elegant.  \r\n\r\nWE LIKE THESE DESIGNS:\r\n\r\nSimple, clean and good use of white space.\r\n\r\nhttp://clearleft.com/\r\nhttp://psd.tutsplus.com/\r\nhttp://www.crowdspring.com/\r\nhttp://tumblr.com/\r\nhttp://kissmetrics.com/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWE ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE THIS IN OUR DESIGN:\r\n\r\nCommon to all of the pages:\r\n\r\nMain navigation will consist of:  \"Event Details\", \"Attendee List\", and \"Messages\".\r\n\r\nIn header:  User name should visible as well as option to logout, and to edit user's \r\nprofile.  Logo (should be simple logotype of EventSession).\r\n\r\nSearch bar that allows for searching for other users, events, keywords.  \r\n\r\nFooter.\r\n\r\nIAB ad units may be chosen from these sizes.  \r\n\r\nMedium Rectangle 300x250\r\nRectangle 180x150\r\nLeaderboard 728x90\r\nWide Skyscraper 160x600","legacy_brief_sections":[],"description":null},"brief_questions":[{"validations":["required"],"help":"","label":"Summarize your project.","name":"description","type":"textarea","answer_label":"Project Summary","description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
