When he was 19, an eyewitness claimed that an unconsious Erasmo was pulled to safety by the the ghost children that supposedly haunt San Antonio's famous Ghost Tracks. Now in desperate need of cash, Erasmo attempts to exploit this incident and places an ad on Craigslist claiming to be a “paranormal expert”.\n\nAfter placing the ad, Erasmo slowly becomes entangled in the strange lives of three clients: Billy, a drifter who claims he can see the future; Leander, a murder suspect who is certain he is being chased by a vengeful spirit; and Nora, a woman who believes her son is possessed by a demon. Certain that they are irrational and unstable, Erasmo is shocked when the drifter correctly foresees several events, the child does indeed show signs of possession, and the suspect actually appears to be haunted by a spirit. \n\nAs Erasmo witnesses this series of inexplicable events, he attempts to unravel their mysteries, including the biggest one of all. When he was 19, did he crawl to safety himself as he remembered, or was he really saved by the children of the Ghost Tracks?\n\nThe author is Celso Hurtado.","select_colors":[["eeeeee","d0d0d0","b2b2b2","949494","777777","595959","3B3B3B","1D1D1D","000000"]],"adjectives":[{"field":"abstract","label":"Abstract"},{"field":"rigid","label":"Rigid"},{"field":"mature","label":"Mature"},{"field":"economical","label":"Economical"},{"field":"classic","label":"Classic"},{"field":"serious","label":"Serious"},{"field":"masculine","label":"Masculine"},{"field":"minimal","label":"Minimal"}],"other_content":"The only text will be the THE GHOST TRACKS, and my name, Celso Hurtado.
