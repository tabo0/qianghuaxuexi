There is a huge need for diapers in America that creates a horrible cycle that traps impoverished families. They need diapers to leave their babies at day care so they can work, but they need to work to get the money for diapers. Nashville Diaper Connection (NDC)  is a new charity with a mission to collect diapers for Nashville families that can't afford them.  We work with local organizations to plan and promote diaper drives similar to food drives for a food bank. We pick up and store donated diapers from these drives. All diapers collected are distributed to local community distribution partners. NDC does not provide diapers to individuals directly.  \n2.  The logo should communicate collecting and donating Diapers (not money collections). Whimsical but not child-like is good. Typical uses will be website, posters, brochures, stickers, receipts, letterhead. \n\n3. Send a message of love, caring, but professionally organized.
