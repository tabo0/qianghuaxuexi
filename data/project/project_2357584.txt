Originally, the Company's prime objective was to serve the needs of the radioactive waste industry by providing treatment reagents for solidification/stabilization of waste destined for land disposal. Fluid Tech also expanded into other aspects of the environmental industry markets by building on its extensive experience and background in radioactive waste solidification reagents and hazardous waste stabilization reagents. \r\n\r\nFluid Tech has divided its product line into three segments based upon different environmental sectors. They are: radiological/hazardous/medical waste absorbents, oil spill remediation, and dust suppression. The following describes the segmented product line backgrounds and applications.\r\n\r\nFluid Tech was founded in order to market certain patented reagents developed for\r\nsolidification/stabilization of radioactive waste. During the past 30 years, seven different reagents have been patented and marketed for use in solidifying low-level radioactive wastes. These reagents are licensed for waste treatment at many U. S. commercial and U.S. D.O.E. radioactive waste disposal sites. They have been used by numerous nuclear power plants world-wide, universities, private industry, national laboratories, and most Department of Energy facilities generating low-level radioactive waste.\r\n\r\nFluid Techs waste solidification agents have a distinct advantage when used because they have\r\nsuccessfully solidified both organic and inorganic wastes and do so by generating significantly less volume expansion than other techniques. In addition, Fluid Tech products have a proven history and a pedigree of success that surpasses any other products on the market.\r\n\r\nFluid Techs main competition comes from superpolymer products (polyacrylates). These products offer impressive loading rates but are more susceptible to releasing liquids during transportation (due to freeze-thaw and vibration conditions), form a \"gel\" that is difficult to manage at disposal, and are ineffective on liquid wastes having a high salt content. Fluid Tech products, when applied at the correct loading rates, will not release liquid under even the most harsh conditions ensuring disposal site acceptance and generator compliance.\r\n\r\nFluid Tech has developed and obtained patents for reagents which are very effective in treating hazardous waste such as heavy metals, oils, and solvents. Fluid Tech products are slightly more expensive than the alternatives (Portland cement, fly ash, etc.), but are much more effective and efficient. Fluid Tech products generate significantly less volume expansion than the above mentioned alternatives.\r\n\r\nFluid Tech, as part of their research into waste treatment, has developed a product, Trans Seal I, which is very effective for dust suppression. There are two markets where these products are applicable. These are: a) coal dust suppression, and b) construction site and other municipal dust suppression.\r\n\r\nFluid Tech has also pursued a derivative of this product for use in suppression of dust in municipalities. A number of municipalities are experiencing severe air quality problems, due in large part to airborne dust particles from construction sites, off-road traffic, and non-improved areas. As dust control regulations become more stringent, the market for Fluid Techs Trans Seal product will escalate.\r\n\r\nFor the past 20 years Fluid Tech has been working on achieving reasonable, effective, and\r\naffordable solutions to large open-water oil spills (ie. BPs Deepwater Horizon Spill in 2009). Fluid Tech processes and products form a system for quick response, damage prevention, and natural bioremediation to clean-up oil spills. This process includes the use of Fluid Techs Pristine Sea product, which binds the spilled oil and allows it to float in clumps. This accomplishes several goals:\r\n\r\n\tallows sunlight to penetrate through the oil slick, limiting damage to the marine\r\nenvironment;\r\n\tprevents oil from sinking; hence, preventing pollution of the water column and floor;\r\n\therds the oil and causes clumping action so that it does not spread; and\r\n\timproves clean-up when the oil is bound in this state. If it washes up on a beach, it will\r\nnot create further problems, as the clumps may be simply picked-up since they do not\r\npenetrate into the sand.\r\n\r\nOnce the oil is bound in clumps, selected microbes (applied at the same time as the\r\nbinding product) begin to naturally bioremediate the oil.\r\n\r\nPristine Sea products have been approved for use by the US EPA and the US Coast Guard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have a desired website screen size?\r\nScreen width.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many pages (maximum of 4) do you need designed?\r\nA page for each product (Absorbents and Solidification Agents, Dust Suppression Products, Oil Spill Response Products) and a page to be able to accept online orders.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is your industry?\r\nOther\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe the target audience for your website design\r\nTarget audience is environmental professionals and first responders requiring absorbents for radioactive/hazardous/medical wastes, dust suppression for the coal and construction industries, and oil spill response products for oil and gas companies.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat 3 things would you like to communicate to your audience through your website design\r\n1. Environmentally friendly.\r\n2. Proven and effective products.\r\n3.

For over 30 years, Fluid Tech products have been proven to work under the most stringent conditions. No other products can claim the pedigree of success or the breadth of application that Fluid Tech products cover.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat website design styles do you like?\r\nBelow is a link to a previous Fluid Tech website:\r\nhttp://www.marinesystems-usa.com/\r\nLinks to competitors sites are:\r\nhttp://www.cetco.com/\r\nhttp://www.m2polymer.com/\r\nhttp://www.americanproducts1.com/\r\nhttp://s94145.gridserver.com/related-resources/EGen_Dust_904_Sellsheet.pdf\r\n\r\nI like the manner in which the following websites captures customer information:\r\nhttp://www.icesolve.net/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat colors do you want to see in your website design?\r\nBlue, green, tan.
