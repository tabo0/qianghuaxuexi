Think of them as two different explorer windows. You are able to drag and drop the circles, to move the \"file\" to a different \"folder\". You can also click inside the grey area to zoom into it, and click on the top orange header to go back. The white area shows the files in the current folder (what is shown in the orange header), while the others shows inside that folder.\n\nPlease go to the URL and test around so you get a better understanding of it.\n\nSo, this is what I want redesigned to look great and make more sense.\n\nFor instance, it might not be obvious that the circles inside the grey boxes are files inside those folders, while the circles in the white are are files in the current folder mentioned in the orange header.\n\nIt's also not obvious that you can click in the area to go to that folder. It's also not obvious that you can click the orange header to go back up a folder.\n\nIf you hoover over a circle (file), you can see the filename and filesize. This can surely be made to look better. Or, to be shown some other way.\n\nThe circle turns red when moved, and it will stay red if an error occurred.
