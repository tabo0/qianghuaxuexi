Ellisson\r\n\r\n\r\nSynopsis\r\nThis first project will lead to two more covers in a trilogy, which I plan to release later this year. It's a light paranormal cozy mystery series, meaning it's appeal to readers is in the quirky setting, characters, and situations that unfold while solving the crime. The paranormal elements in the book are slight, and do not overwhelm the plot.\r\n\r\nThe first book is titled Death in the Campground and features Jennifer Lanzetti, the main character in the series, who is a travel writer on assignment touring and writing about the US in a fifth-wheel trailer (this is a type of travel trailer that overhangs a pickup truck's bed while towing). \r\n\r\nShe's traveling with her two black Pit Bull terriers, and after getting hit on the head she is able to hear her dogs talking. They help her solve the crime of a fellow camper being poisoned and I'd like to see them on the cover, if possible.\r\n\r\nJennifer is of Italian descent, with long wavy black hair. She's in her late twenties and she's curvy. The series name, which I'd also like on the cover, is Jennifer Lanzetti Mysteries, Book One.\r\n\r\nFor inspiration, I'm looking for a design with similar appeal and branding elements as the following series: \r\n\r\n-- Angie Fox's Southern Ghost Hunter Mysteries \r\n-- Leighton Dobbs' Silver Hollow Paranormal Cozy Mystery series\r\n-- Zoe Arden's A Haven Wicth Cozy Mystery series\r\n-- Yasmine Galenorn's Chintz and China series\r\n-- Annabel Chase's Spellbound Paranormal Cozy Mystery series\r\n\r\nPlease include the moniker New York Times Bestselling Author above my name. I've also hit the USA Today list if you'd like to include both (although my other paranormal series uses the one).\r\n\r\nSince branding elements are very important to me, I'd like to to see something on the cover that can carry from one book to the next that includes the series name, or a symbol, like two dogs heads to represent the Pit Bulls, named Rex and Regina.\r\n\r\nI do not have a book description ready for the back cover at this time.
