We want to be very creative here, so no idea is too “out there.”\n\nOur bus was once an airport shuttle bus. The interior is being converted into a beautiful working space for our fast-growing team, but the outside still needs some love. We want to turn our bus into a reflection of our company: creative, welcoming, and unique, with a clear message. Zello is for everyone, and we believe in the power of voice to bring people together.\n\nThe bus will spend a lot of time in our parking lot, serving as extra space for us, so we want it to fit in with our surroundings: a converted Craftsman house surrounded by trees. However, it will also be used for our events at South by Southwest, a Startup Crawl, and more, so we want it to convey who we are and what we stand for to anyone who sees it. We’ll be driving all around Austin, a city that prides itself on WEIRD (notable vehicles around town include the Mystery Machine a hearse with pink windows, and a car with longhorns mounted on the grill), so we’re open to all sorts of ideas! This is going to be driving around Austin, so both locals and tourists will be seeing this.\n","initial_content":"Submit your project by following the list below:\n\nTheme Name: \nName of your concept\n\nExplanation of theme: \nTell us what your concept is about and how it communicates what Zello is. This is going to be driving around Austin, so both locals and tourists will be seeing this.\n\nArtwork Mockups:  \nPlease base all designs on the attached files, where we have shown which parts of the bus we will want wrapped (the orange parts). You can do your 5 mockups for each side of the bus on the blank sketches (ones without orange parts showing).\n\nThese should all be vector files, and should not include any stock images. We’ve included our logo, and our media kit can be found here: zello.com/media-assets/. You can use anything there to help with your design, or create illustrations of your own. Please keep in mind that the orange color seen in the logo is used sparingly, only as an accent color. \n\nPassenger side of bus artwork:\nDriver side of bus artwork:\nFront of bus artwork:\nBack of bus artwork:\nRoof of bus artwork:\n\nPotential copy on bus: \nIf you have ideas on messaging that communicates what Zello is while relating to your theme, enter that here. Remember, the bus will be moving, so people will have to read quickly.\n\nLink any examples of artwork style here: \nHave examples of inspiration to add? Please put it here.\n","select_fonts":["sans_serif"],"select_colors":[["f44336","4CAF50","2196F3","FFEB3B","673AB7","FF9800","00BCD4","795548","777777"]],"description":"We make a mobile app that redefines the walkie talkie.

Our push-to-talk app allows people around the world to connect to each other in private conversations and public channels. It has saved lives during natural disasters, enabled free speech in countries where that right is not guaranteed, and built lasting friendships. And we know that’s just the beginning.\n\nWe are inspired by a simple belief: when people make connections through instant live voice, they can become more cooperative, more compassionate, and less isolated. \n\nWe have two versions of our product. One is a free global social network for individuals, with 120 million users. The other provides thousands of organizations with private push-to-talk networks. \n\nOur target audience for free Zello encompasses everyone - we want to get the entire world talking! Our target audience for paid ZelloWork is made up of companies needing secure, private communication. We offer significant advantages over traditional radio/walkie talkie systems, so we are used by retail chains, hospitality companies, transportation providers, and more."},"brief_questions":[{"help":"","type":"textarea","answer_label":"Project Summary","description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
