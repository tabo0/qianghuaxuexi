We like to say we are \"mining urban resources\" aboveground so we don't have to dig up oil or cut down more trees. Until now we have been based in Ontario, Canada - we are hoping to expand throughout Canada. We want people to know that we are taking a modern approach to waste management. We use a state-of-the-art automated system to divert as much material from landfill as possible. A very popular term in our industry these days is \"circular economy.\" We are the ultimate example of the \"circular economy\" in action, and we would like people to think of us whenever they hear that term. We also need to show our customers that we are dependable and fast to respond to their concerns. We want customers to feel like they are doing the right thing when they choose to work with us: good for the environment and good for bottom-line.\n\n\nWhat logo styles do you like (image + text, image only, text only, etc.)\nWe are mostly looking for a strong image to unite the two branches of our company: Canada Fibers and Urban Resource. Urban Resource has a number of subdivisions (Urban Waste Recycling, Urban Garden Products, Urban Biofuel, Urban Polymers.) We will eventually want a way to unify all the brands so we can drive home the point that as a company we play many role along the chain of the circular economy. Text should be included with the image, but we also want the image to stand alone. \nThings to stay away from: Green - too many of our customers using those colors. Open to a unique shade of green though. Recycling symbol - we don't want the chasing arrows recycling symbol in the logo. \n\nProvided two ideas of ideas we're thinking through. The triangle with lines in it - looks a little like the recycling symbol and has lines in it to represent \"UR\"/ \"Urban Resource.\" Circle with 3 lines coming out - we get in mixed material, run it through the circle,  and distinct products come out if it. We'd like to see different variations of these. We would love to somehow include a circle, but we are hesitant. So many groups in our industry are using circles to represent the \"circular economy\" - an important value, but a bit overdone. Would be great to overlap with a circle or include in background...
