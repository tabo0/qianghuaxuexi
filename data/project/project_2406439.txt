The product we need your design assistance for is a pillowcase, with the palm side of a hand flocked onto one end such that the user's hand rests comfortably on the felt palm when the user's head rests comfortably mid-pillow.  A compatible hang tag and instruction sheet would be helpful, but not essential.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many pages of print design do you need?\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nList the size requirement(s) for your print design\r\nLandscape layout 20\" x 30\" to be printed and flocked onto a 100% quality cotton pillowcase. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is your industry?\r\n Health Care and Biotech\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe the target audience for your print design\r\nThe target market is home health agencies.  The target user is a home health patient.  This is not a product that a person can buy for themselves.  It has to be a gift.\r\n\r\nThis is the process: the home health agencies will purchase these pillowcases in bulk with their logos added above the flocked hand for their advertising.  Each of their patients will be given a pillowcase upon the first home visit.  The enclosed instruction sheet will tell the home health worker to use the enclosed laundry-proof marker to sign a note and encourage whoever else is present to do the same.  The hang tag will be left on the pillowcase to remind the patient to ask others to do the same when they come to visit.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat 3 things would you like to communicate to your audience through your print design?\r\n1.  The product is a TACTILE reminder to lonely home-bound patients that they remain connected to people who take good care of them -- both the professional home health agency and others who come to visit them at home.  The \"fabric of connectedness\" is the concept.\r\n\r\n2.  Anecdotally, these pillowcases, when used as directed, have been shown to reduce isolated patient anxiety and depression.  The handwritten notes are the first thing the patient sees before going to sleep and the first thing seen upon awakening.  So \"peace and comfort\" should be communicated through color/design.\r\n\r\n3.  The buyers are the home health agencies.  The recipients/users/patients could be of any race, religion, gender.  So the appeal needs to be universal and not offensive to any group.  The design needs to feel \"open and friendly\" to anyone who is ill.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat print design styles do you like?\r\nAt the moment, my functional design involves only a white pillowcase with the flocked hand towards the closed 20\" end of the pillowcase with the product name \"there with you\" printed under the palm.  To my mind, my layout doesn't look balanced visually, but I want open space to invite folks to write on the pillowcase.  I anticipate having to include various home health agency logos above the hand.  I don't know how those will look.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat colors do you want to see in your print design?\r\nThis is where I need help.  Colors soothing for sleeping, rest and healing would be good.  I don't know if the flocked palm print should be in a pinkish life-like tone or something unrelated to skin color to avoid any appearance of racism.  I believe the flocking process sticks me with one uniform color for the hand, which I'm not crazy about but this may be a functional limitation.  If you know of another applique process with more variety, please let me know.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your print design?\r\nI leave the question of color up to the designers.  Neutrals perhaps would be good??  I'm a physician who has designed a tactile therapeutic product.  I don't know how  best to present it visually.  Home health agencies will have their own logos to print on, which could be in any color.  Or I could tell them we only print logos in one particular color that goes with your design.  I'm just not sure.  Advice please.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat adjectives should best describe your print design?\r\nhopeful, soothing, peaceful, friendly, supportive, restful and regenerative.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow will you use the print design?\r\nI think I've described that above, but please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat content must be included in the print design?\r\n1.  Background is a pillowcase one side (20\"x30\") :\r\n\r\nA. One palm print -- 71/2\" as longest dimension.\r\nB. \"There With You\" as product name\r\nC.  Blank space for a home health agency logo\r\nD.  Blank space for folks to write messages to the patient\r\n\r\nNot essential, but I'd also like to see:\r\n\r\n2.  Permanent Small Hang Tag stating: \r\n\r\n\"Personalize this pillowcase as if it were a plaster cast or a get well card.  Write a note with laundry proof marker for to the user to see upon awakening, while recuperating, and when falling asleep.  Add a scent appealing to user if appropriate\"\r\n\r\n3.  Instruction sheet to home health worker stating the following:\r\n\r\nStep 1:  At patient upload, open the plastic bag, and write a note on the pillowcase using laundry proof marker as if the pillowcase were a \"get well\" card or a plaster cast.  \r\nStep 2:  Ask whoever else is present, family or friend, to do the same.  \r\nStep 3:  Put pillowcase on the patient's pillow and encourage patient to touch the felt hand as a soothing reminder that he/she remains connected to caregivers between visits.\r\n_________________________\r\nThe images attached are suggestive for placement.  They are not to scale.  Please consider the imbalance (unwanted) in design, and the name is \"There With You\" not \"with you\" as represented in the image.  The palm shape must be filled in with color/design because the product is primarily tactile.  Artwork must be in format acceptable to manufacturers.","description":null,"legacy_brief_sections":[{"questions":[{"legacy_domid":"id_business_name","value":"The JDMD Foundation, Inc.","label":"Business Name","legacy_field_id":1244076,"name":"business_name"},{"legacy_domid":"id_what_do_you_do","value":"Our mission is to assist those living with less than optimal social support and their caregivers to live happier, healthier and more independent lives through the use of touchable objects that extend and enhance their relationships.
