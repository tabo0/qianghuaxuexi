This means at times our target audience changes.\r\n\r\nAgents - Worldwide\r\nWe have agents spread out around the world helping workers secure jobs in Canada. Agents typically register, receive approval and submit resumes on behalf of workers.\r\n\r\nWorkers - Worldwide\r\nWorkers from around the world apply for jobs in high demand. Jobs currently in high demand include trades work, construction workers, hospitality industry, and more.\r\n\r\nEmployer - National\r\nEmployers request our help filling jobs which are in high demand. One employer may be looking for their next aerospace engineer while a franchise might be looking for twenty chefs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat 3 things would you like to communicate to your audience through your website design\r\nTrust and Credibility - Because we deal with a lot of international clients we want clients to feel comfortable.\r\n\r\nHelpful - That we are here to help and this does not end on our website. We help new workers get settled into their new city. We help each individual find an apartment, setup a bank account, and help them get comfortable in a new city.\r\n\r\nKnowledgeable - We are experts! We have been helping people find and secure jobs in Canada for years. \r\n\r\nTrust, Helpful, Knowledgeable are the main things we want to communicate to our audience.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is your company different from your competitors?\r\nWe help workers from the start to the finish. Which means from the moment the resume is sent to the day they arrive at the airport. We help our workers orientate themselves.\r\n\r\nI think this is uncommon and a lot of our competitors simply do not care.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat website design styles do you like?\r\nTo me job portals or job board seem rather boring. I created this design request hoping to find something unique and creative!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat colors do you want to see in your website design?\r\nPlease feel free to use whatever color you feel best represents your overall design. I do not want to restrict your creative process.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your website design?\r\nNone, we do not want to restrict your creative process.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat adjectives should best describe your website design?\r\nclean, helpful, powerful\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat content must be included in the website design?\r\nHomepage\r\nJob Listing page / Worker Listing Page / Agent Listing Page (same page different type)\r\nSingle Listing page\r\nProfile page\r\nWe do not have a logo however I am fine with a basic test logo similar to oDesk or Pingdom.
