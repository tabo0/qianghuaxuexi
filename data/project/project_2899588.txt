It means insurance companies being able to provide a personalised quote without asking any questions, or customer being able to check they are on the right phone or broadband plan without having to speak to anyone. Itâ€™s accurate data powering frictionless and instant engagement with millions of customers, all at once. \nWe use unstructured data, so it shouldn't feel too linear or 'computerised'. Rather the opposite - its about grabbing and drawing together lots of different data particles to form an identifiable form/solution.\nWe wouldn't want to see cliches for accuracy such as 'targets'. We want to feel modern but don't want to be cold, mechanical or industrial. The company the feel should be light and smart. The 'wizard' or 'magician' is brand personality archetype - think Magneto in X-Men.\nSome of the brands we admire seem to have very simple elegant playful typography, but there is high degree of craft/detail in the design that makes it stand out - a great example being the V&A Museum. The logo is great and the new colours on the website are striking.\nAnother but different example we liked is in this work by Interbrand work for Airbus (see link: http://interbrand.com/work/unconventional-learning-for-airbus-group-leadership-university - the multi coloured swirls is a cool way to represent diverse thinking coming together). \nWe have selected text rather than an emblem so the design focuses on core brand, but if you prefer it could have additional elements surrounding it, eg as the paint effect in the airbus example above .
