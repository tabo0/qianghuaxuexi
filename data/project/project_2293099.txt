Customers only need one card -- the Five Stars Card -- to check-in to any store on our platform. We give each business a barcode scanner and a stack of Five Stars Cards, and they set a reward for their customers (i.e., buy 9 coffees/books/entrees/haircuts and get the 10th free).\n \nA typical customer interaction goes like this: Customer walks up to cashier to pay. Cashier says, Do you have a Five Stars Card yet? We scan your card every time you buy a coffee then after 9 visits, we give you one free! Cashier scans the card and asks for the customers phone number (which can be used to check in if they ever forget their card). Cashier says, Thanks for your orderremember to register your card online! After 9 visits, the customer gets an email from Five Stars informing theyve received a reward. This card can now also be used at any other store in our network.\n\nWe ARE NOT a software company, we are a web 2.0 company focused on viral marketing through social media (i.e. Twitter posts / send free food to friends through FB status updates) and finding consumers great deals (a la Groupon) at places they actually visit.\n\n\nDo you have a desired website screen size?\nstandard\n\n\nHow many pages (maximum of 5) do you need designed?\n2 - (1) landing page: the frontpage of the non-logged-in, public part of the website. The page should feature how the Five Stars Card works for consumers and include a large call to action to register card. Also needs testimonials section that vouches for our value-add to businesses and consumers, (2) content template to be used for rest of site [3 sections: i. reward dashboard (to see how many stamps you have), ii. deals (think groupon), iii. account info (change phone #, etc.)]\n\n\nWhat is your industry?\nReward programs (for small businesses), similar to companies like Starwood Hotel Points or American Airline Frequent Flyer Miles but more of a contemporary web 2.0 feel like Foursquare or Groupon\n\n\nDescribe the target audience for your website design\n-General public (anyone who picks up a card at any of our stores)\n-Cater to 20-30 year old crowd without alienating 50+ demographic\n-Want to make customers excited\n-Customers will come to site for the following reasons:\n(1)See how many visits they need for their next reward\n(2)Redeem promotions our businesses send directly to them\n(3)Look at exclusive deals offered through our platform\n\n\nWhat 3 things would you like to communicate to your audience through your website design\n(1) Ease of use  No more stamp cards.

The main goal of the homepage is to get people to enter their barcode and email/facebook connect, and provide them with an easy overview of how the card works.\n\n\n\n\nWhat colors do you want to see in your website design?\nshades of blue are nice, want the site to be on the darker end (for the polished/refined feel) but not too dark (e.g., black)!
