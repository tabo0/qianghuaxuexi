Our business is to provide consumer goods manufacturers with a full picture of how people consume their products.  We have developed some proprietary software, social networking concepts and new statistical methods to accomplish this in a unique fashion. We have assembled a team of well respected industry veterans for this venture.\r\n\r\nOur brand image is:\r\n- Professional and \"buttoned up\"\r\n- \"Rocket Science\" statisticians, analysts, and market research professionals\r\n- Technologically cutting edge\r\n- Thought leadership and creativity\r\n- Strong customer advocates\r\n- End user/consumer friendly\r\n- Extremely experienced in our field\r\n\r\nHERE IS WHAT WE NEED:\r\n\r\nWe are looking for a corporate logo and icon that will be used across our business, including:\r\n-on our web site (consumics.com), which will have both a consumer and customer component\r\n-printed sales materials, \r\n-business cards, \r\n-mobile applications\r\n-emails and other communications to end users\r\n\r\nSpecifically, we are looking for the following\r\n\tA logo with the company name  - Consumics\r\n\tLogo should work in both color and in black and white\r\n\tLogo should be clean in design and appeal to both corporate customers and end users alike\r\n\r\n\tAn icon that can stand alone and can be used in Mobile apps.  If both elements can be drawn together and work together, that's a big plus but not a requirement. As long as we can split them apart as well and use the icon standalone. \r\n\r\nWe are considering using the theme of creating a consumer mosaic, so it would be great to see some ideas with reflect that concept.  We'd also be interested in seeing a treatment with an icon representing consumption (eating or drinking, like the new Pepsi Logo, for example)\r\n\r\n Typically, logos in this industry are fairly flat and boring. We don't want boring, but it should be on the conservative side.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR TARGET AUDIENCE IS:\r\n\r\n\tCorporate leaders, such as VP of Sales, VP of Marketing, Brand Managers, etc.\r\n\tEnd users, individuals who will be using our applications. Over time, we may develop two different logos but for now will go with one.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE LIKE THESE DESIGNS:\r\n\r\nHere are some logos we like:\r\nLinkedIn, Intuit, zemanta.com, www.shutterfly.com, www.crowdspring.com\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are a few other entrants we saw on Crowdspring that we like, to give you some more sense of our taste:\r\nhttp://www.crowdspring.com/project/2281349_logo-design-for-askclaudettecom-portal/entry/2308784_askclaudette/\r\nhttp://www.crowdspring.com/project/2281390_logo-for-a-new-social-marketplace-for-services-uknowacom/entry/2309076_uknowa/\r\nhttp://www.crowdspring.com/project/2281258_logo-design-for-new-software-project-named-grml-forensic/entry/2308471_-/\r\nhttp://www.crowdspring.com/project/2281158_logo-for-standpoint-wave-energy-development-project/entry/2298592_-/\r\n\r\n\r\nWere partial to blue or blue/green schemes but are open to other suggestions as well.\r\nWe prefer simplicity over complexity so nothing extremely cute or whimsical.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE THIS IN OUR DESIGN:\r\n\r\nMust use a free font. \r\n\r\nNo icon that references any specific product or type of product that may be consumed (for example, no icons with someone drinking a can of Coke or chewing a stick of gum) \r\n\r\nLogo formats will also be used in printed materials, so vector based formats are important.","legacy_brief_sections":[],"description":null},"brief_questions":[{"validations":["required"],"help":"","label":"Summarize your project.","name":"description","type":"textarea","answer_label":"Project Summary","description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
