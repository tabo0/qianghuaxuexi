We consider ourselves to be forwarding thinking but not trendy.  The founding attorneys are a 30 year old man and 29 year old woman, who both are fashionable and would like our logo/stationery to display that. \r\n\r\nHERE IS WHAT WE NEED:\r\n\r\nWe are looking for a logo and stationary that is sharp, modern, with clean lines and not trendy. It will currently be used on our business cards, letter heads and advertisements, and then will eventually be tied into our website.  \r\n\r\nOUR TARGET AUDIENCE IS:\r\n\r\nOur target audience are clients looking for a law firm that will place their needs first and provide top quality service with attorneys who have a background specific to their needs.  We will have a primary focus on clients who have suffered personal injury and or have a products liability case. We want our clients to feel that we will provide them with excellent legal representation, forward thinking solutions, and that we will zealously represent them.\r\n\r\nWE LIKE THESE DESIGNS:\r\n\r\nColor wise we like dark blues (maybe a little lighter than Navy) with whites and possible silver.  Our logo we would like to include S&A and the full name of the firm somewhere around it.  \r\n\r\nWe would like the back of our card to have a solid color that dark blue with our web address: \r\n\r\nwww.shainfeld-anvar.com\r\n\r\nThe style we like is modern, clean lines, but not trendy.  Sharp.\r\n\r\nWE ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE (or we don't want to see) THIS IN OUR DESIGN:\r\n\r\nWe do not want cursive or calligraphy.
