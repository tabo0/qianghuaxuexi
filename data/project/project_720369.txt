Some of my past websites include Prosper.com, BrowserCam.com, and EmailReach.com.  I am the sole customer on this project (there is no committee ;).  \r\n\r\nHERE IS WHAT WE NEED:\r\n\r\nI need a website design that includes \r\n\r\n1) The Home page\r\n2) The signup page (basic forms)\r\n3) The main logged in page (that includes a book queue and book suggestions (a grid of books)\r\n4) A design for the use of tabs.\r\n\r\nThe site uses mouse-overs, a modal box, and auto-complete forms.  So you'll need to work through some AJAX style designs.  The pop-ups have some basic animation which I'd like you to help stylize too.\r\n\r\nIf you are capable of implementing the design up in CSS, I'm open to contracting for that work after this project is signed off. Just let me know.\r\n\r\nOUR TARGET AUDIENCE IS:\r\n\r\nThe audience is really the mom (not the child), so I want the site to appeal to your basic soccer mom type who is college educated, wants their child to read more, is comfortable buying things on the internet, and is probably familiar with Netflix.\r\n\r\nWE LIKE THESE DESIGNS:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/  -- Like the colors and use of photography of books rather than icon or abstract.  The forms are a little small (http://www.goodreads.com/user/new), I'd rather have a larger font for forms.  I like this the best.\r\nhttp://www.itsunfortunate.com/ -- Love the colors.  Love the 3D of the cookie.\r\nhttp://shiflett.org/ -- Like the headlines and fonts.  Probably too busy for us, but a simpler version would work. Don't like the fixed width.  I want some flexibility on the width.\r\n\r\nAs you can see from the sites I want a very *warm* site, plain and simple.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE (or we don't want to see) THIS IN OUR DESIGN:\r\n\r\nWe don't  have a name or logo or colors for the site yet.  (We're still trying to secure a domain.)\r\n\r\nI set my screen captures to gray scale so my own horrible design skills don't offend you.  \r\n\r\nI like the netflix site, but don't love it (the red) -- but the popups and simplicity are terrific \r\n\r\nYou might be temped to think of this as a kids book site.  Don't.  It's for the moms.  Cute = bad.\r\n\r\nHere's an alternative site http://www.readkiddoread.com/  Good site.  Not for us.  The saturated colors distract from the books themselves and tightly packed design would make it very hard to reliably code the dynamic portions of the site.  White space is our friend on this project.","description":"I am building a website that will deliver childrens' books by mail to families a la Netflix style of rental.  The target family is one with children 6-12 years old\r\n\r\n\r\nReference sites are available in the private brief as well as screen shots of the wireframes.  \r\n\r\nI have used CrowdSpring before so I am familiar with the process.  I promise to be very responsive with detailed feedback.  If I don't like where the design is headed I promise to \"fail fast\" and tell you so you're not wasting time iterating on a design that's going nowhere.\r\n\r\nIf your design is accepted I will serve as a great reference for you both on CrowdSpring or any other client reference check.","legacy_brief_sections":[]},"brief_questions":[{"description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
