It is a middle to upper income level area with many professionals and high levels of education. The area tends to be more conservative. Our church is made up of all ages.\n\n\nWhat are the top 3 things you would like to communicate through your logo?\n1. Clear river gets its name from the gospel of John where Jesus speaks of the River of life. The river is a symbol of life not only in a personal sense but in the idea of bringing life to others.\n\n2. We are Ancient/Future - meaning that our church uses some elements in our worship that have been a part of worship for hundreds of years, at the same time our music is contemporary and our style is casual. \n\n3. Three things?? This is hard now. I'm sure words like \"unique\" get over used and mean little. The only other thing I can come up with is \"antique\" - but cool. Going back to that Ancient/Future thing. \n\n\nWhat logo styles do you like (text only, image only, text and image, etc.)?\nOpen to logo and text - or text only. Ideally, we'd like an image that can stand alone on stationary or become well known enough in the community that it's associated with the name.\n\n\nWhat colors do you want to see in your logo?\nBlues and greens - but open to other suggestions.\n\n\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your logo?\nHarsh blacks or reds.. \n\n\nWhere will your logo be used (print, website, etc.)?\nAll of the above! Needs to be scalable, looking good in large and small sizes. Looks good in color but doesn't get lost in black and white. Used on everything social media-wize.\n\n\nDo you have other info or links you want to share?\nVERY IMPORTANT - Please. NO wandering rivers flowing from the mountains or into the sunset. No glowing crosses - crosses are okay but should look rough edged or Celtic. No angels, doves, or open bibles. In other words, no clichs  Needs to be more masculine than feminine.  \n\nNice samples here: http://goo.gl/V2Nfd\nHere: http://goo.gl/Dg6ZX\nhttp://www.edgepointchurch.com/\nhttp://www.whereeverylifematters.com/\nhttp://www.allsaintschurchdallas.org/","legacy_brief_sections":[{"name":"Business Info","questions":[{"name":"Business Name","legacy_field_id":119652,"value":"Clear River Community Church","label":"Business Name","legacy_domid":"id_business_name"},{"name":"What is the exact name you would like in your logo?","legacy_field_id":119653,"value":"Clear River Community Church","label":"What is the exact name you would like in your logo?","legacy_domid":"id_exact_name_in_logo"}],"label":"Business Info","legacy_field_id":119651},{"name":"Target Audience","questions":[{"name":"What is your industry?","legacy_field_id":119655,"value":"Church","label":"What is your industry?","legacy_domid":"id_your_industry"},{"name":"Describe the target audience for your logo","legacy_field_id":119656,"value":"Clear River is located in Fairfax County in northern Virginia.
