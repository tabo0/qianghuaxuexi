We are creating that science by partnering with data scientists, mathematicians, statisticians, and healthcare practitioners. We envision a future where SDOH risks are identified and quantified, potential interventions are scored and prioritized, and there exists an analytics-curated marketplace for community interventions.  We are fusing clinical and claims data with outside contextual data to build holistic models of people, the communities they live in, and their interactions with the healthcare system. Through that process, we are creating a SDOH risk score, a FICO score for healthcare, which will help health systems and health plans more comprehensively understand their patients and how to support them.  Our analytics go well beyond gathering data about people, as we seek to understand the most important questions in healthcare: Why do some adhere to clinical instructions and others don't? What barriers (healthy food, transportation, access to facilities) do people in the community face? What unique conditions exist in neighborhoods that are driving healthcare outcomes?","select_fonts":["no_preference"],"select_colors":[["BBDEFB","90CAF9","64B5F6","42A5F5","2196F3","1E88E5","1976D2","1565C0","0D47A1"],["eeeeee","d0d0d0","b2b2b2","949494","777777","595959","3B3B3B","1D1D1D","000000"]],"description":"We need help developing icons to represent the seven categories of the social determinants of health.
