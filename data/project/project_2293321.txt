Two of the facades face a quaint square at the end of historic Tharia Street, a principal thoroughfare for walking tours of the city. The third faade looks down Tharia Street toward the Anglican Cathedral and the slave market.  Nestled among the rear facades is a squared private courtyard containing an ancient well. \n\nSpice Inn\nThe principal structure which now houses Emerson Spice is actually a melding of two buildings and several distinct styles of architecture. The older L-shaped wing on the Northeast side, built in the Swahili Arab style, was originally owned by the son of the last Swahili ruler of Zanzibar, known as the Mwinyi Mkuu. The buildings actual age cannot be established, as no records exist earlier than 1826, when it was registered in the first census of buildings conducted by Seyyid Said, the founder of the Omani Sultanate in Zanzibar. It remained in the same family until 1870 when it was purchased by a Hindu businessman, Patel, a well-known trader of spices and local products. Mr.Patel added the western and southern wings, which in design and detail reflect his Indian heritage.  After the building was appropriated during the 1964 revolution, it eventually passed into the hands of Mr. Sharbaidi, who owned it at the time Emerson came to Zanzibar in 1989.  The two men became friends and often talked about the buildings potential.  But at the time, it was still leased to Mr Sharali Champsi, who had opened the original Spice Inn in 1980.  The Spice Inn was one of the first hotels in Zanzibar after the revolution and one of the few extant when Emerson opened his first hotel, Emerson House, in 1990. After dreaming of restoring this building for years, Emerson and his partners eventually acquired the building in 2006.\n\nShia Market House\nThe building, adjoining the old Spice Inn pair of structures, was a commercial and residential structure which, until the revolution, housed small craftsmen workshops and businesses on the ground floor and residences above.  Although the exact year of its foundation is not available in the public records, it is rumored to have been built in the 1850s.  This is consistent with the style and methods of construction still visible. It is also apparent the building underwent construction of three additions over a period of about twenty years, ending about 1870.  The newest section faces Tharia Square on two sides.\n\nUnfortunately, as the building was largely abandoned after the revolution, its condition was appallingly dangerous. This damage was to the extent the interior required complete demolition, although we are able to save the characteristic exterior walls. \n\nThe Inner Court\nThe inner courtyard, which will contain a fountain and peaceful garden, revealed some of the most interesting artifacts unearthed by our excavations.  The most interesting and historically significant is the water well.  This well lay hidden under the nearly two meters of rubble which buried most of the courtyard, a result of decades of neglect. On the side of this well was attached a cast iron plaque testifying to its registration in 1826 by the Sultan Seyyid Said, the founder of the Omani Dynasty and Sultanate in Zanzibar. Upon further excavation, we found that the well still provides abundant fresh water which is now used for cleaning and gardening.\nWe also found two mysterious crypts made of hardened lime.  We hoped and half expected to find buried treasure or perhaps tombs.  Unfortunately someone had beaten us to it!  They were already stripped of their contents.\nAmong the rubble, we found numerous artifacts confirming the legendary use of the building.  Most notable was thousands of abalone and oyster shells.  This gives credence to the story that there was a jewellery store specializing in mother-of-pearl.  The large number of shards from large, colored chemical bottles testifies to its housing the first photographic studio in Zanzibar.\n\nEmersons Philosophy of Hotel Development\nDeveloping a hotel in a city which is both a World Heritage Site and an impoverished, underdeveloped community requires a special sensitivity to both the physical and social environments.  This sensitivity is, however, well reimbursed by the final product which brings social benefits to the neighborhood and a beautiful, authentic environment which is generously appreciated by the guests.\n\nOur Philosophy in Action\nEmerson has been a leading activist in the struggle to preserve Zanzibars physical and cultural environments.  During the twenty years that he has lived in Zanzibar, he has managed to save a dozen buildings from collapse.  His restorations are praised not only for their designs but also for their attention to the artistic details of the structures and for his use of traditional methods and craftsmanship. His craftsmen have set the standards for which all other restorations aspire to achieve, and their reputations have earned them employment from UNESCO projects all over the region.  Among these artisans are several women who have broken the sexual barriers to become respected builders in their own right.  \nAll this care and attention to detail is readily apparent in the restoration at Emerson Spice. Emerson designed each door and each balcony individually as different expressions of patterns and motifs found traditionally in Zanzibar.  Now that so much of Zanzibar has been lost, some of these are the sole reminders of the original artistry. \nOn the socio-cultural front, Emerson has been the inspiration and founder of many of the most successful initiatives in the region.  He is a founder of the Zanzibar International Film Festival, the Festival of the Dhow Countries, Busara Music Festival, the Dhow Countries Music Academy and the Zanzibar Stone Town Heritage Society.  He has tirelessly worked for various womens groups and other organizations to enable the handicapped.\nFor the above reasons, the Emerson Spice project is already viewed as an integral part of the community, and the neighbors see themselves as part of the team in its development.  They have worked, advised, guarded, preserved, benefited from, and celebrated with us the progress of this project.  When our guests walk through the neighborhood, they may expect an especially warm welcome.  Meet them for a game of Bao, in front of the hotel.\nThe Emerson Spice \no\tEmerson Spice aims to take the leading position as the top of Boutique Hotels in Zanzibar Stonetown\no\tReconstruct and restore the three buildings in a traditional manner and using original materials and methods, working with local craftsmen and artist preserving the blend of the diverse cultures that comprise Zanzibar. \no\tEstablish as an up-market Boutique Hotel of twenty one rooms, caf, rooftop restaurant and health club/SPA facilities\no\tIn the restoration at Emerson Spice, Emerson designed each door and each balcony individually as different expressions of patterns and motifs found traditionally in Zanzibar.
