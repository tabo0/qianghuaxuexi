This range is so large - it's the high school kid down the street in his first band, it's the professional touring musician, it's the hobbyist with a ton of gear in his late fifties. \n\n\nWhat are the top 3 things you would like to communicate through your logo?\n1. Simplicity - The logo should be sleek enough to both indicate the below items and the impression that the site is easy-to-use/navigate.\n\n2. Trust - We want to communicate that we are peers in the music industry - the logo should indicate a familiarity with instruments and gear, but also give a sense of authority - We're not really looking for silly.\n\n3. Dynamism - We somehow want to give the impression of movement/vitality that indicates the audio/musical experience. We're open to designs that have concrete elements (say, a guitar or an amp) but also to more abstract designs (that indicate, for example, a soundwave or an arpeggio). \n\n\nWhat logo styles do you like (text only, image only, text and image, etc.)?\nThe logo should be a combination of an image and text that can be used together, or isolated from one another. The image should be able to stand for the name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat colors do you want to see in your logo?\nWe are open to most color combinations. The palette should be limited to a range of 2-4 complimentary hues that would work well with a predominantly greyscale design of other company elements.\n\n\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your logo?\nAlthough acceptable in a complementary palette, please avoid excessive browns, yellows or oranges. For example, we'd be ok with a pale yellow supported by grey or a deep red. \n\n\nWhere will your logo be used (print, website, etc.)?\nThe logo will be used primarily online. It will be reproduced in print - but the proportion is very small.\n\n\nDo you have other info or links you want to share?\nWe like the cleaner logo of Guitar Center: http://www.guitarcenter.com/ to the older look of Sam Ash: http://www.samash.com\n\nWe also like the clean lines of these fashion retailers for inspiration:\nhttp://www.oaknyc.com/ or http://www.blackbirdballard.com/\n\nWe would, however, like to incorporate color into the design. This is important.","legacy_brief_sections":[{"questions":[{"legacy_domid":"id_business_name","value":"GearTrack","name":"Business Name","legacy_field_id":124144,"label":"Business Name"},{"legacy_domid":"id_exact_name_in_logo","value":"GearTrack","name":"What is the exact name you would like in your logo?","legacy_field_id":124145,"label":"What is the exact name you would like in your logo?"}],"name":"Business Info","legacy_field_id":124143,"label":"Business Info"},{"questions":[{"legacy_domid":"id_your_industry","value":"Music Industry","name":"What is your industry?","legacy_field_id":124147,"label":"What is your industry?"},{"legacy_domid":"id_target_audience_logo","value":"GearTrack is a web-based app that will potentially target all owners of musical instruments.
