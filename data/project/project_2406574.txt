This is my first time to branch out on my own with my own brokerage. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the exact name you would like in your logo?\r\nJ Headley Properties\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat specific designs do you need?\r\n[u'Business cards', u'Letterhead', u'Envelopes']\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is your industry?\r\n Real Estate and Construction\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe the target audience for your logo and stationery\r\nBuyers and sellers of ages 22 and up. Male, female, urban, suburban, rural, residential and commercial. I do not generally find myself working with properties with values less than $250,000. I have sold properties at just under $2M.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat 3 things would you like to communicate to your audience through your logo and stationery?\r\nGenuine, straight to the point, not smarmy. I am not about flash and sizzle. I am about making sure my clients do not make a mistake with their choices and I could care less about how much money I make.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat logo and stationery styles do you like (text only, image only, text and image, etc.)?\r\nHeavier on text, but I am ok with an image. I usually lean towards \"Images\" that are a single letter, hahah. I like a good use of blank space. I'm not into cheezy iterations of the name of the company made into a house logo or something. I created a little logo on a template on canva.com that I actually like the style of, but my husband thinks I could do better. But it's a good idea for you to start with.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat colors do you want to see in your logo and stationery?\r\nMy current company uses navy and kelly green, which I love, but it's hard to see the signs. I need my signs to have a white background for maximum visibility. I love orange, navy, all shades of grey, kelly green. Kind of preppy or classic. The template logo I made that I'm attaching has colors that I didn't change. I don't hate the beige-ish banners, and it does seem classic, but it's also kind of boring. And I wouldn't know what to change it to anyway! I do love that grey though.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your logo and stationery?\r\nI do not want a red, white and blue sign like every real estate agent on the planet. Bleh. I need mine to stand out and look refreshing. Like, \"oh thank God, something different\".\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat adjectives should best describe your logo and stationery?\r\nSimple, friendly, welcoming, dedicated, experience, no-nonsense, dedicated\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere will your logo be used (print, website, etc.)?\r\nI will use my logo digitally and in print, and especially on signs. I would like to have a square-ish application for when that is appropriate, and then a longer, flatter application as well. Does that make sense? I would love for you to design a real estate sign for me too. it needs to say Broker somewhere on the sign and it needs to have the phone number 713-909-0202. 28\" x 20\", vertical.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have additional info or links you want to share?\r\nThis is my current look: https://www.facebook.com/jamieheadleyrealtor/","legacy_brief_sections":[{"questions":[{"legacy_domid":"id_business_name","value":"J Headley Properties","name":"business_name","legacy_field_id":1245334,"label":"Business Name"},{"legacy_domid":"id_what_do_you_do","value":"I am a real estate broker in the Houston, TX area.
