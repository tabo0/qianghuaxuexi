Together, they’re a juxtaposition of light and dark, elegance and funkyness, personal and playful. Stepping into the book case doorway between Whiskey Room and Charbar, the visitor experiences an extreme contrast in environment. From Charbar's fun, lighthearted feel, the bright colours and lighting—within a few steps, these elements segue into a mysterious space with warm, muted lighting and the murmurs of bar patrons to invite further curiosity. Following the camouflaged bookcase door, the patron is presented with more visual cues of the traditional speakeasy: elaborate displays of bottles of liquor, a blend of dark and dim, plus a motley crew of furniture pieces that hints at the evanescence of these establishments as they were in the past. Continuing the play on eras and expectations, we integrated a number of contemporary intrusions throughout Whiskey Room. The first of these is a striking copper drop ceiling: an array of  copper squares cascading towards the floors creates a mysterious allure for guests to further explore the the depths of the space. We also created two installations featuring bottles of liquor. The first is a floor-to-ceiling shelving unit standing right next to the entrance, with a 10' x 8' display of whiskey bottles that has a built-in spotlight on bottles to illuminate the amber glow of the liquid inside. The second is a the whiskey bar itself, a full wall installation featuring rows of bottles that take center stage—like the speakeasy itself, the backbar is dimly lit to show the silhouetess and the outline of the whiskey bottle shapes to give the viewer an artsy display\n\nThe rest of the space is designed to feel private and personal. Lighting is kept minimal and muted, with several base points throughout the venue each emitting a warm glow of light that bounces off one another. The most prominent of these is the copper lighting arrangement in the inside of the drop ceiling, which diffuses subtle amber light from the overhead. This light reflects off of the cascading copper tiles on the other end of Whiskey Room, creating an overall glowing effect that lifts the conventionally imposing feeling of low ceilings.\n\nLed lights against the slanted mirrored backdrops running parrallel down the space on top of the distressed walls reflect the patrons, creating an illusion of depth that makes the wall seem to disappear and enlarge the long and narrow space. \n\nTo add to the warm, cozy feel of the venue, we created partitions in the seating area that transition with natural ease. Looking from the right side to the left of the venue, and then back to front the heights of the seats and table surfaces are lowered, raised, and lowered again in increments to create a dynamic landscape within a compact, enclosed space.The ambiance will provide a prohibition era atmosphere and capture the warm, rustic feel of an upscale saloon from the turn of the century with the staple distressed brick walls, and diml lighting showcasing a copper ceiling to the hidden secret bookcase entrance from nieghboring restaurant Charbar Co. coupled with the antique light fixtures, wall moldings, stained wood, vintage mirrors, all evoke an older, more dapper era of drinking, with the first impression of the disguised entryway lending the affair the thrill of the illicit... Whiskey Room will feature of 100 whiskeys and bourbons, with a bourbon club, and nightly music featuring jazz era musical playlist with a modern twist.
