Recognized nationally and\r\ninternationally, the Institute promotes collaborative work\r\nrepresenting different fields and institutions both within and beyond\r\nthe University of California. UCHRI addresses topics traditional to\r\nthe humanities in disciplines such as literature, philosophy,\r\nclassics, languages, and history, as well as the pressing human\r\ndimensions that arise in the social and natural sciences, technology,\r\nart, medicine, and the professions. Stressing interdisciplinary\r\nresearch, UCHRI bridges gaps between disciplines across the humanities\r\nand human sciences and seeks to overcome the intellectual and\r\ninstitutional barriers that can separate the humanities from other\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nThe Institute interacts with UC campus humanities centers and with\r\nindividual faculty to promote collaborative, interdisciplinary\r\nhumanities research and pedagogy throughout the UCs and within the\r\nlarger communities they inhabit. Each year UCHRI hosts research groups\r\nin residence, initially soliciting proposals for group projects and\r\nsubsequently seeking fellows whose work will contribute to and be\r\nenhanced by the Institutes unique collaborative environment. A wide\r\nrange of conferences, seminars, workshops and other research projects\r\nthroughout the UC system are also supported by UCHRI. In general, the\r\nInstitute is characterized by its convenings: research groups,\r\nnetworks, collaborations, and other innovative ways of scholars\r\nworking together.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about the Institute, visit our website at\r\nwww.uchri.org. Note that UCHRI is a founding member of HASTAC (the\r\nHumanities, Arts, Science and Technology Advanced Collaboratory) at www.hastac.org\r\nand co-administers the MacArthur Foundation Digital Media and\r\nLearning Competition (www.dmlcompetition.net). HASTAC recently\r\ncompeted its logo through Crowdspring; to see the results of that\r\ncompetition, click on http://www.crowdspring.com/projects/graphic_design/logo/logo_redesign_for_hastac_humanities_arts_science_and_technology_advanced_collaboratory\r\n. UCHRIs intellectual sphere is broader than digital technology, but\r\nit is an important component of our program. \r\n\r\nHERE IS WHAT WE NEED:\r\n\r\nWe need a new logo design that will be used on all collateral\r\nmaterials and on our website. The design should highlight the\r\ninnovative, collaborative nature of the Institute in a compelling\r\nimage or icon. \r\n\r\nOUR TARGET AUDIENCE IS:\r\n\r\nOur design should appeal to an audience of faculty, students, digital\r\ninnovators, researchers, and the general public. \r\n\r\nWE ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE (or we don't want to see) THIS IN OUR DESIGN:\r\n\r\nWe absolutely must have (or we don't want to see) this in our design:\r\nWe absolutely must have a design that is fresh, modern, compelling and\r\nappropriate. The logo must be accompanied by the acronym UCHRI and we\r\nwould also like to see a treatment that integrates the logo with the\r\nfull name, the UC Humanities Research Institute. We are open in\r\nterms of color palette, font choice, and other such aesthetic\r\nconsiderations. We invite you to put on your creative hat, think out\r\nof the box, and come up with an iconic image that captures this lively\r\nand dynamic organization.","description":null,"legacy_brief_sections":[]},"brief_questions":[{"description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
