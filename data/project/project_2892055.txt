This talent is sourced through referrals only: direct and via select partner recruiters. \n\nOur target audience is three-fold (in order of priority):\n1.\tEmployers / Hiring Managers:  line managers; business owners; in-house talent acquisition teams; people and culture (HR) leadership;\n\n2.\tTalent:  candidates at Manager level and above (salary AU$180k plus per annum) across industries and high-value job type / function;\n\n3.\tRecruiters: select senior external recruiters.\n\nValue Proposition (for all three parties involved): \n\n•\tHiring Managers:  Sharplist is a productivity tool. We cut through the static to remove the hassle involved in sourcing and hiring (time & risks) involved in sourcing and hiring high-quality, high-demand and low-supply talent.  \n\n•\tTalent:  Sharplist is selective, and provides a discreet, differentiated advocacy based channel to the hidden job market – ideal for both networking and access to tangible job opportunities.   \n\n•\tRecruiters: advocate for and help people - and as a function of this, better monetise your time and inventory. Sharplist automates and aggregates the proactive ‘float’ process (proactive marketing of active or passive candidates to companies ), whilst enabling you to represent and potentially place select talent with businesses outside your existing community. \n\nOnce accepted onto Sharplist, a digital profile /  dashboard (“dossier”) is developed for each candidate, incorporating elements from: \n\n•\tA lean CV highlighting their critical experience, core skills, competencies, strengths, ‘gaps’ (areas of weakness/ lacking), interests and achievements;\n\n•\tonline testing/ assessments (IQ/ EQ/ style/ personality/ strengths / weaknesses); \n\n•\tbackground due diligence: reputation, online research and reference checking.\n\nEach candidate is verified, assessed and profiled across a number of key dimensions which help align the right candidate to the right organisation and role including:\n\n•\tCore values/ drivers\n•\tCore skills and competencies\n•\tPersonality type (strengths and weaknesses)\n•\tEmployee type (e.g. Cherishable, Change Agent, Rainmaker, Leader, Maverick, High Potential etc.)\n•\tLeadership style \n•\tReputation\n\nEmployers / Hiring managers have access to these profiles, ranked based on powerful search capability to align with hiring managers requirement / filtered preferences. \n\nInitially, employers have access to a limited, high-level candidate profile but can unlock the profile to view the detailed elements of the “dossier”.\n","add_pages":[{"description":"Home page with multiple sections driven by menu as per below:\nAbout us - overview of Sharplist and the overall value proposition\nFor Hiring Managers - overview of how Sharplist works for and benefits employers (ideally in a visual manner)\nFor Talent - overview of how Sharplist works for and benefits candidates (ideally in a visual manner)\nFor Recruiters - overview of how Sharplist works for and benefits recruitment companies (ideally in a visual manner)\nOur clients - space to put logos of companies working with Sharplist\nWho we are - space for bios of the Sharplist founders\nContact us - contact form and details (including ability to attach a file)\nLogin - login button or widget\n","title":"Home"},{"description":"Login window or pane with username, password","title":"Login (reached by clicking on login)"},{"description":"User entry form for candidates to provide basic information and upload their CV and any other validating documents.","title":"Candidate landing (reached by clicking on login and authenticating as a candidate)"},{"description":"Landing page which should be tabbed with the following sections:\nMy candidates - profile of each candidate associated with the recruiter including basic stats such as number of views, search terms, rank order, time on platform\nInsights - visual insights showing key trends - e.g. key search terms, industry activity, top skills, growth of platform users, growth of candidates, candidate turnover, distribution of time on platform for candidates etc.\nMy performance - performance of the recruiter - search rank, candidate ranking, number of profiles views, interviews arranged, placements etc.\nBilling summary - transactional view of billing events and links to invoice PDFs\n","title":"Recruiter Landing (reached by clicking on login and authenticating as a recruiter)"},{"description":"Landing page which should be tabbed with the following sections:\nHome - my recent searches that can be expanded to view top level of best matching profiles, profiles you may be interested in - a handful of profiles matched to the company\nMy talent pipeline - The ability to add specific roles, characteristics and timeframes that can be expanded to view top level of best matching profiles\nInsights - visual insights showing key trends - e.g. key search terms, industry activity, top skills, growth of platform users, growth of candidates, candidate turnover, distribution of time on platform for candidates etc.\nMy activity - transactional view of all billing related events over time\n","title":"Employer Landing (reached by clicking on login and authenticating as a company hiring manager)"},{"description":"Search results with profiles 2 columns wide.
