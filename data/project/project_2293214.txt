The companys founder has over 35 years in the IT business along with 18 years of colocation and data center ownership and experience.  By leveraging these colocation and data center relationships, the company has evolved to also provide managed IT services, often called cloud computing.

YourColo has a small company feel with big company resources. While YourColo specializes in small- to mid-size enterprises, theyre open to customers of all sizes. The emphasis is on creating long-term partnerships.
