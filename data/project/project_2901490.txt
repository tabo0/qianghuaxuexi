This first one is an examination of spirituality, with some poetry mixed in. The other two books are poetry related to spirituality and social issues. These are not religious books.

I don't know if this is photography or graphic illustrations. I'm leaving that up to the artist. I am the author of all three books. The plan is to publish all three with Kindle Direct. The book cover has to be formatted for both Kindle Direct ebooks and print paperbacks, and a hardcover version to use with a possible third-party distributor. I may include ISBN barcodes to be added on the hardcover and paperback.","cover_style":["illustrated","photo"],"company":"This is not about an organization.
