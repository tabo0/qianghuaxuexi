Which includes Cajun, Creole & Award Winning Barbecue.\n\nOur cuisine is prepared using farm FRESH, NATURAL ingredients creating exceptional food with BOLD flavors.\n\nWe take our name from a part of rural Southeast Missouri known as the \"Bootheel\" [boot-heel]. The Missouri Bootheel is the southeastern part of the state where the Missouri border dips down in to Arkansas forming a rectangular-shaped extension that resembles the heel of a boot. Some might say it’s a “panhandle”. \n\nOur name is often mispronounced so it would be great if there is a way to help people understand where the name comes from.\n\nThe Bootheel region is unique! It brings together the culinary influences not only from Missouri, but those of Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas and even Texas! The Bootheel's proximity to the Mississippi River means that over many years, generations of travelers with diverse cultural backgrounds influenced the region. This created a cultural melting pot that shaped the culinary techniques and flavors of the region. These early travelers and settlers used a variety of farm fresh ingredients and cooking methods that produced incredible food with bold flavors….our food is reflective of this style of fresh and inspiring cuisine.\n\nOur client base is located in the Washington DC metro area. So we work in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia. 60% of our business is in Northern Virginia.\nOur client base is about evenly split between men & women however 70% of our buyers/decision makers are women.\nAge is 25-75 years old with the average age range 35-55.\nOur clients are affluent – very affluent and very well educated. \nWe cater parties of all types, including birthdays, wedding receptions, corporate outings, any type of celebration. \nWe work in private homes, parks, office buildings, pretty much anywhere our clients have a party. \n\nOne of our tag lines is “Barbecue to Black Tie” which indicates the type of party we cater can be super casual with disposables and a buffet to formal with china, linens, silverware, passed hors d'oeuvres and a seated dinner.\n\nAdditionally, some things we do that set us apart from other caterers in this area.\nWhole Barbecued Pigs – using all natural, locally raised pigs \nCrawfish Boils – using fresh live crawfish flown in from Louisiana. \nFish Fry’s - using only domestic farm raised catfish  \n\nI want to convey the following…\nOur name: Bootheel Catering\nWhat makes us different/special: Bold Fresh Natural \nWhat we do/our specialty Southern Cuisine to include Cajun, Creole & Award Winning Barbecue (or just Barbecue)\n\nWe have two tag lines which can be incorporated in your design, but it is not mandatory.\n\"Fun Food For Festive Occasions\" has been used the most but we also use  \n\"Barbecue to Black Tie\"! I don’t know how to incorporate both messages into a shorter simpler line. \n\nAlso this will be our new logo moving forward so it will be on our website\nwww.bootheelcatering.com and it will also go on our new food truck.\n\nWe are very open to your vision of this logo but please don’t send us drafts that look like something has just been thrown together. I can do that myself!\n\nThank you for your time!\n","anything_else":"If I think of something I will send it as an update.","select_fonts":["no_preference"],"logo_style":["no_preference"],"top_3":"1.
