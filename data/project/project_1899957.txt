Join us as we share experiences, strategies, and best practices that will help injury and violence prevention programs continue to persevere as they turn challenges into innovative opportunities.\"\r\n\r\nThe annual meeting will take place in Ann Arbor, Michigan from April 14-16, 2010.\r\n\r\nThe logo will be used on all conference materials, including print materials, emails, our website, signs, posters, and promotional items (e.g., bags, pens, etc.).\r\n\r\nOUR TARGET AUDIENCE IS:\r\n\r\nThis meeting is an annual gathering of our 300+ members, all of whom are injury and violence prevention professionals from around the country. Our membership includes men and women who are ages 25-50+ years old, well-educated, and work in a variety of organizations, including health departments, hospitals, universities, and other non-profit organizations.\r\n\r\nWE LIKE THESE DESIGNS:\r\n\r\nWe really like the design that a crowdSRING creative designed for our conference earlier this year:\r\nhttp://www.stipda.org/displayconvspecific.cfm?convnbr=5468\r\n\r\nAlso, here's a creative conference logo we like that was designed by two of our partners who hosted a joint conference last year: http://www.naccho.org/events/asthonaccho2008/\r\n\r\n\r\nWE ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE (or we don't want to see) THIS IN OUR DESIGN:\r\n\r\nLogo Designs Absolutely Must:\r\n- Connect the theme to a visually appealing image\r\n- Consist of a simple yet sophisticated design\r\n- Translate well in full color, as well as in black and white\r\n\r\nAlso, we like color, so feel free to use colors as you see fit. The only colors that must be incorporated in some way is our blue (Pantone 287C) and our co-sponsor's purple (Pantone 259C).\r\n\r\nLogo Designs Should NOT:\r\n- Refer to our organization's name in the design\r\n- Have \"human-like\" figures used in the graphic:","description":null,"legacy_brief_sections":[]},"brief_questions":[{"description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
