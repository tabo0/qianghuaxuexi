In other words, “Services” should not be of equal size and placement.\n\nThe logo will need to work with a tagline/descriptor line.\n\nThe logo must work in black and white as well as in full color and will be used in print and digitally.\n\nWhat we do NOT want to see…\nWhile Saint Vincent’s Services is an entity of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Fall River, Massachusetts, we do not want to see any graphic marks, or other design elements (including typography) that would communicate something religious about the organization and its services.\n\nSaint Vincent’s is not a hospital, doctor’s office, nor an orphanage.\n","top_3":"•\tProfessionalism\n•\tChildren and Family Focused\n•\tTrustworthy\n","industry":"community-non-profit","how_logo_used":["print","screen_digital","clothing","outdoor","signage"],"select_fonts":["sans_serif","serif","block_serif"],"company":"Saint Vincent’s is a Massachusetts-based nonprofit organization that works with children, young adults, and families to work towards leading safe and healthy lives in the areas of mental and behavioral health.
