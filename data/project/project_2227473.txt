Our spaces are never cookie cutter.  Ever. \r\n\r\nIn choosing our properties, we primarily focus on historic properties that have unique charm and attributes, located in up-and-coming communities. Environmentally conscious, we focus on green and modern design - mixing the old with the new.  \r\n\r\nTo effectively achieve our vision, we manage all aspects of the development process  including site selection, project design, legal approval and permits, materials selection, construction and management.\r\n\r\nDiligence, hard work, creativity, and attention to detail all play a role in getting our projects done on budget and in a timely fashion.  We hope our projects are inspirational and have a meaningful impact on residents and the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERE IS WHAT WE NEED:\r\n\r\nWe need help creating a new logo and business card.  The logo will appear on all corporate communications, marketing materials, proposals, websites, signs, etc.  to create a visual identity.\r\n\r\nIdeally, it will clean, versatile, modern and professional  something youd see or expect from an architect or designer, or edgy online startup.\r\n\r\nThe design may be as simple as the two words of our name in an interesting font, juxtaposition, texture, angle, stamp, and/or contrasting color(s).  It may or may not include a graphic/iconic element  a picture, swirl, symbol, skyline, etc. We like gradients, interesting lighting, reflections, texture, and love typeface.\r\n\r\nOptional:  \r\n\r\nWe would like to see options/ideas for two-sided business cards.\r\n\r\nWe would also like to see options using a tagline somewhere on the logo and card that suggests what we do.  Weve toyed with the following mottos and taglines and are open to creative suggestions:\r\n \r\nResponsible Development\r\nImproving. Developing. Helping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR TARGET AUDIENCE IS:\r\n\r\nThe marketing collateral will primarily be used for interactions with potential investors, partners and clients.  \r\n\r\nInvestors - busy, educated, affluent, savvy professionals.  money managers.  hedge funds.  \r\n\r\nPartners - architects, developers, banks, designers, tv networks\r\n\r\nClients - individuals, families and businesses in need of project management or consulting.\r\n\r\nWe take pride in being intelligent, trustworthy, well thought out, creative, unique, cutting edge, and growing.... we'd like it if the design could demonstrate some of those qualities as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWE LIKE THESE DESIGNS:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.inhabitspace.com/\r\nhttp://www.thinkriskins.com/\r\n\r\nWe like the two different colors for the different words.  The colors and the way they sort of fade in and out.   And the reflection or shadow of the letters below.  And the design for the dot over the \"i\" in think risk.\r\n\r\nhttp://cardobserver.com/gallery/elemental-architecture\r\nsimple, clean, minimalist, nice texture.\r\n\r\nhttp://cardobserver.com/gallery/job-design\r\nWe like the color, the font, the use of a bars that could be viewed as a skyline or buildings.  And the simple, but interesting logo designed out of the two letters of the companys name.\r\n\r\nhttp://creattica.com/logos/connected-matters/3\r\nSimple use of color for the tagline and swoosh icon going through the name. \r\n\r\nhttp://creattica.com/logos/spoke-logo/18672\r\ninteresting use of color.  Contrast.\r\n\r\nhttp://webdesignledger.com/inspiration/15-beautifully-minimal-business-cards\r\n\r\nhttp://www.eventlabwired.com/?page_id=36\r\ncombination of colors, tagline below name, clean..\r\n\r\nhttp://cardobserver.com/gallery/ploc-media\r\ninteresting.  stands out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWE ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE (or we don't want to see) THIS IN OUR DESIGN:\r\n\r\nThe only thing the design must have is the name of the business - Mixed Projects\r\n\r\nWe do not want anything difficult to read, overly cutesy, or something that looks like it came from a stock warehouse.\r\n\r\nWe uploaded two graphic designs that also caught our eye and attention.","description":null,"legacy_brief_sections":[]},"brief_questions":[{"description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
