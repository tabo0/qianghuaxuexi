The navigation screen, on the other hand, should display a map with more detailed navigation information and turn-by-turn directions. Critically, we want to include much of the same key information that is displayed on the home screen on the navigation screen as well. This way the user will be able to toggle seamlessly between the home and navigation screens and see all relevant information on both screens. The main difference will be how the information will be prioritized on these two screens. On the navigation screen, the map and directions will fill most of the screen with more subtle display of the vehicle speed (MPH), battery, and range. By contrast on the home screen the speedometer will be the main focus of the screen with a more subtle display of the navigation direction and distance to input destination."}],"platforms":["ios","android"],"vision":"The key to a winning app will be cleverly integrating the navigation info (direction of destination and distance to destination) into the main page (e.g. an arrow in the center of the speedometer) and cleverly integrating the speed/battery/range info into the GPS page.
