Austin has been called many things over the years: the Live Music Capitol of the World, the City of the Violet Crown, the Bat City, the San Francisco of the South, and, most recently, the Silicon HIlls.  \r\n\r\nAt Technology Navigators, we like our newest nickname the best. Austin is bursting at the seams with technology companies, from small start-up ventures to big multi-national companies with bigger names (hint: think Google, Apple, etc.). Overall, we're proud to be Austinites and we think it's part of what makes who we are and what we do so unique.\r\n\r\nFrom the client's perspective, Technology Navigators develops businesses and augments staff by finding and delivering extraordinarily skilled candidates to fill contract, permanent, and contract-to-hire positions within their company. We're a hiring manager's best friend, because when it comes to searching for just the right person to fit a company's culture with the necessary skillset and experience to boot, we do all the work.We pre-screen and interview all the potentials and narrow it down until we find just the right match. \r\n\r\nFrom a candidate's perspective, we are a lifesaver. We navigate them through floods of job postings and help them determine what they're looking for in a position and where they're best suited to make their own waves. We also provide the means for those who are looking to work independently or for their own corporations to take on the best assignments with many different companies and to eliminate gaps between one project and the next. Because we are contracted to work with the best, we provide access to positions that aren't on the market, present them to the company's executive hiring managers, and see them through the interview process and beyond to an employment relationship that is profitable for all. \r\n\r\nFrom both the client and the candidate's perspective - we know the people you need to know to grow!\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the exact name you would like in your stationery?\r\nTechnology Navigators\r\n\r\n\r\nYou'll receive designs for biz cards, letterhead and envelopes.\r\nWe also need a design for 3 variations of a 3 x 5 1/2 greeting card.\r\n1. Thank you: This will be used (primarily) to send to client executives and hiring managers to thank them for their business upon signing a new staffing agreement or after a presentation, etc. \r\n2. Congrats/congratulations: Our recruiters will send these to someone who has just accepted the offer of a new permanent position.\r\n3. Logo and/or company name only: These will be for general use - such as occasions when \"thank you\" is not appropriate. \r\n\r\nThe design for the accompanying envelope should include our logo and return address on the back flap. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is your industry?\r\nConsulting and Professional Services\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe the target audience for your stationery\r\n-executives and hiring managers at technology companies, both national corporations and local start-ups\r\n-technology professionals, including programmers, QA managers, technical writers, Java developers, software engineers, web developers, executive IT management, software quality assurance, Microsoft developers and network engineers\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat 3 things would you like to communicate to your audience through your stationery?\r\n1. A glimpse of what we do, but not the whole story. We know it's a lot to ask. We want the look of our designs to make an impression that sparks curiousity. Think seduction, instead of assertion. Alluring, instead of imposing. Not aggressive, intrusive, or forceful, but inspiring. \r\n2. Well-crafted, authentic, quality. Real and good, and really good.  \r\n3. The importance of relationships and people: Our business is built on relationships. In fact, this is our unique selling proposition and it's central to what we do. Remember: we know the people you need to know to grow!\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat stationery styles do you like?\r\nImaginative and original: without sacrificing the clean, polished look of a well-crafted design. \r\nBold and eye-catching: We want the look of our designs to make an impression and sparks curiosity and inquiry.\r\nProfessional: While we want to avoid the generic and too-formal business, we want to portray quality and excellence. We'd like to trade the stuffy and imposingly formal (also generic) look for one that conveys authenticity and quality. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat colors do you want to see in your stationery?\r\nWe have four color values used in the design of our website, which is the basis for the look and feel of our brand. See the attached image for the color values and swatches, and browse our website to get a feel for how we'd like them to be used. \r\n\r\nNote: because we're considering printing our greeting and business cards with just two PMS spot colors instead of full CMYK, we're okay with seeing designs that predominantly utilize the blue and tan. But you're the creatives, so give us what you got! \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your stationery?\r\nWe would like to avoid an overbearing use of the teal color. It provides a fantastic \"pop!' on the website, but we don't want it to be a primary element in the design. \r\n\r\nSome other things we don't want to see: \r\n1. Circuit boards and anything else that is stereo-typically technical or technology-themed. If any representation of programming language is used, please keep it faint and not a predominant aspect of the design. \r\n2. Anything overly-nautical: This is not the basis of our company's culture! \r\n\r\nWhat we DO want to see: \r\nA focus on people and relationships. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat adjectives should best describe your stationery?\r\nDistinct: eye-catching and unique, without looking cluttered or overly-intricate. We want to reflect our brand and capture our look and feel without producing an ostentatious effect. It's also important that we don't blend in. Technology themes are often over-utilized and a total bore, so when in doubt - skip it. \r\n\r\nApproachable: We're a rapidly growing company, but we're also focused on building and maintaining lasting relationships with our clients, contractors, and candidates. In short, we're real people communicating with other real people and we want the look of our stationary to align with that perspective. \r\n\r\nRefined: Clean, high-quality design that reflects a commitment to excellence. In particular, we'd like to avoid a corny or kitsch effect involving the overuse of the nautical or technology themes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have additional info or links you want to share?\r\nPlease review our website at: http://technologynavigators.com/ \r\n\r\nWe have attached the TrueType font files for the fonts used in our logo and on our website.
