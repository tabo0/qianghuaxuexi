Current operating companies include Small Parts, Inc. (www.smallpartsinc.com), ABC Metals, Inc. (www.abcmetals.com) and HTI (www.callhti.com). They are in the process of rebranding their entire corporate identity, and are starting with the MPI logo. They have a very specific message of they want to communicate with the logo, and it is as follows:\r\n\r\nThey believe strongly that their company serves its employees and their communities by providing meaningful and fulfilling employment to hard working individuals. As MPI grows so do the lives of their individual employees. They believe strongly in giving back to those individuals and their families for their service to their companies. \r\n\r\nThe concept of \"Building Businesses, Enriching Lives\" is what we want to communicate visually. But we want to use the concept of a circle, or a series circles representing both the cyclical nature of their business philosophy, but also the idea of intersecting circles (the individual) and (the businesses) coming together in a positive way that is greater than the sum of the parts. I will include examples of what I mean. Please refer closely to the examples as they are all great visual explanation of what we are looking for. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat logo styles do you like (image + text, image only, text only, etc.)\r\nReally we want the logo to have a strong image using a circle or an interaction of circles representing their employee/business in sync philosophy. The text we would just like to see \"MPI\".\r\n\r\nJust a strong image and MPI. We do NOT want any other text on the logo at this time. We might ask for it to be added in future revisions, but we would like all initial designs to be strictly an image and MPI. \r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have any other info or links you want to share?\r\nHere are 5 examples we STRONGLY like.
