The Stargrazers cookbook offers the unique experience of dining in a distinctive 5-star celebrity establishment without having to leave home. The heart of the cookbook will be the recipes featured at these restaurants, as well as stories of the celebrities who will share their passion for fine dining with us all. \r\n\r\nHERE IS WHAT WE NEED:\r\n\r\nStargrazers logotype. Will be used for everything from website (coming soon) to it's cookbook cover. Like celebrity autographs, I would like Stargazers to have it's own unique signature. And since this logotype will be on a cookbook cover I would need the letters to be legible. \r\n\r\n\r\nOUR TARGET AUDIENCE IS:\r\n\r\nFoodies, fans. I want our readers to enjoy both the gourmet recipes that define celebrity restaurants and the restaurants where they were developed.  \r\n\r\nWE LIKE THESE DESIGNS:\r\n\r\nI have attached a jpg which shows the colors I am leaning toward. The colors are spicy with an undertone of exoctic. I chose them because I feel they adapt well to photographed food. I prefer to stay away from the color blue. I also attached our current logotype which uses the font GreyQO. Even though I like it, it just doesn't have the \"it\" factor that I'm looking for. Which is why I have come to the www.crowdspring.community of creatives. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWE ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE (or we don't want to see) THIS IN OUR DESIGN:\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that the recipes included in this cookbook reflect fine-dining. So think upscale as opposed to glitsy. Also, the celebrities included in this cookbook are actors, musicians, athletes and artists, so themed logotypes such as Hollywood film will not work for this project. Please keep it generic to all celebrity types. One more thing, since this logotype will actually be on a cookbook cover, I would not like to see open books incorporated into it.","description":null,"legacy_brief_sections":[]},"brief_questions":[{"description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
