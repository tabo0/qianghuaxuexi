Similar to Home Depot and Lowes.\n\n\nDescribe the target audience for your logo\nOur demographic is very wide.  We sell to men and women doing small home projects as well as professional builders doing complete houses or commercial projects.  The logo needs to lean more to the \"tough\" side of things--as in not frilly.  Think of targeting professional builders with callused hands and muddy boots.\n\n\nWhat are the top 3 things you would like to communicate through your logo?\nWe care about our customers. We help our customers get the job done on time and under budget.  We provide the services and products you need to make your home better.\n\n\nWhat logo styles do you like (text only, image only, text and image, etc.)?\nI like the way Valvoline owns the V and Safeway Food and Drug owns the S, we might be able to do that with a \"W\" but it may also be better to try to get our whole name out there because it is known in our trade area.  See attached.\n\n\nWhat colors do you want to see in your logo?\nRed, Black, Gray, maybe Green. We don't have color standards yet but that will need to be addressed in the future.\n\n\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your logo?\nYellow, Orange, Purple\n\n\nWhere will your logo be used (print, website, etc.)?\nThe logo will be used on our future web site, but should be versatile enough for print.  We will embroider the logo on uniforms, decal on trucks, and use on billboards.  Logo will need to work in black and white, grayscale, and full color.\n\n\nDo you have other info or links you want to share?\nI've attached our old logo, but don't let that be too much of a guide as it is very flat and uninspired.  I know the roof theme is overused but I think it works for our industry if done correctly so it is okay to try.  I would also like to see a design proof sheet so I'm setting a high standard for this work.
