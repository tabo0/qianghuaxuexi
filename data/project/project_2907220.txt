The target audience is young professionals looking to stay active at home and people who work from home.","audience":"Bryan is a freelance software engineer who works from home. He's 27, male, college educated, and makes a decently good living. Bryan doesn't have a gym membership and instead prefers to use sports activities, bodyweight workouts at home, and at-home fitness equipment to stay in shape. Since Bryan works from home, he likes to stay active by doing a few pull ups whenever he gets up to go to the bathroom, grab a drink, or head outside. That way he doesn't have to think too much about working out. Bryan lives in an apartment with a few roommates, so sometimes he needs to take down the pull up bar so it isn't in the way. When he does this, he stores it in his closet. The problem is, when Bryan stores his pull up bar in his closet, he forgets to put it back up. Sometimes it takes days, weeks, or even months before he puts it back up. If Bryan could just keep his pull up bar on the door all the time, he knows he would use it way more. Bryan is value oriented. He does buy expensive things but only if its value is worth the cost. Bryan appreciates high end design and craftsmanship in products but doesn't mind buying economical stuff if it accomplishes the goals the product should meet.","purpose":"This pull up bar is mounted in a doorway just like a normal pull up bar but does not need to be taken down in order to allow the door to close. This way the user does not ever have to take it down and forget to put it back up. It may be designed in such a way that it does not impede the door at all, or it may be designed in such a way that it can be moved out of the way to not impede the door, but still stay mounted in the doorway.","description":"Design a pull up bar that does not impede the doorway it sits in","price":"One time fee. Pricing will depend on cost of manufacture but could be anything from $30 to $200.","vision":"Think white, minimalist, gymnastics equipment. Everything you need and nothing else.\n\nThe pull up bar must not require any power tools or drilling into the doorway to install.\n\nPull up bar must allow a door to close and still stay up (it can move out of the way if needed)\n\nPull up bar must NOT use a telescoping style in order to support weight, or if so, must be reinforced somehow.\n\nPull up bar must be able to support weight when the door is open. The bar does not need to support weight or stay in place when the door is closed.\n\nCan still be accessible for people who aren’t super tall.\n\nNICE TO HAVE: If the pull up bar is such that it moves out of the way of the door, then when the door is opened, the action of the door moves the bar into position. When the door is closed, the action of the door moves the bar out of the way of the door.\n","industry":"physical-fitness","select_fonts":["sans_serif","mono"],"top_3":"Quality, creativity, ease of use.","company_name":"Stealth Company","product_size":"It should be approximately the same size as a standard doorway pull up bar.","competitors":[{"description":"Premium doorway mounted pull up bar","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Ikonfitness-Pull-Up-Bar-Original/dp/B0798J8ZP1/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?ie=UTF8&qid=1547007742&sr=8-1-spons&keywords=pull+up+bar&psc=1"},{"description":"Doorway mounted pull up bar with extra handles","url":"https://www.amazon.com/ProSource-Multi-Grip-Chin-Up-Pull-Up-Doorway/dp/B002YQUP7Q/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1547007742&sr=8-4&keywords=pull+up+bar"},{"description":"basic doorway mounted pull up bar","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Iron-Gym-Total-Upper-Workout/dp/B001EJMS6K/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1547007742&sr=8-3&keywords=pull+up+bar"},{"description":"Telescoping doorway mounted pull up bar","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Garren-Fitness-Maximiza-Pull-Screw/dp/B00RJFRV1K/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1547007742&sr=8-6&keywords=pull+up+bar"}],"anything_else":"Sketches of design notes are attached below and viewable in this link:\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZkO3KkktW73OsdcKkO22O6pVFf0mGEW3\n\nProblems with other designs\nStandard pull up bar\n\n https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41d0SNw4dsL.jpg\n\nhttp://easybuypal.com/wp-content/uploads/how-doorway-pull-up-bar-works.png\n\nThe big problem is this design blocks doors from being closed.

Either they do not mount securely and will fail when supporting a person, or they can cause damage to the door frame by exerting pressure against the inside of the frame. I’ve tried them before and almost hurt myself when it fell. They can be made solid by drilling into the door frame, but that isn’t always possible for people like college students and apartment renters who can’t drill into the door frame.\n\nHere is an image of a standard doorway for reference\nhttps://www.hometips.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/diagram-of-door.gif\n\n\nNOTE: YOU DO NOT NEED TO DESIGN FOR EXTERIOR DOOR JAMBS, ONLY INTERIOR DOORS.\n\nStandard interior door jamb design\nhttp://www.handballtunisie.org/upload/2017/10/29/out-of-sight-standard-door-frame-door-frame-diagram-picture-separated-parts-standard-door-standard-door-frame-l-58d194cabdd2ec85.jpg\n\n","select_colors":[["eeeeee","d0d0d0","b2b2b2","949494","777777","595959","3B3B3B","1D1D1D","000000"],["f44336","4CAF50","2196F3","FFEB3B","673AB7","FF9800","00BCD4","795548","777777"]]},"brief_questions":[{"validations":["required"],"label":"Summarize your project.","answer_label":"Project Summary","type":"textarea","help":"","description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
