The purpose of the new design is to provide clean and simple visual navigation to the site's pages. Basically, consider iPhone application icons and overall layout as the main source of inspiration for this project. Further, Ive attached a sample image to clarify the concept of the required design. \n\nThe overall design, of the webpage and icons, should ultimately match the logo theme and colors. For your info, the logo is an abstract of an aerial view of an island, where the dark blue represents the deep water, the light blue represents the shallow water, the yellow represents the sands, and the green represents the forest. I hope this description will aid as another source of inspiration.\n\nAlthough blue is my favorite color, I would like to avoid using it as the main color since it is excessively used in many sites. Therefore, I would like to have the background in light yellow or green, a grade of either color that is comfortable to the eyes, noting that you can also use blue as a secondary color. The contents/body background will simply be white.\n\nThe size of the body design will be 980 pixels, whereas the total size with background area will be 2000 pixels.\n\nThe icons drawing and background should be harmonic with the site theme and logo and must provide very clear representation of their subjects, i.e, sun/cloud for weather forecast page.\n\nWhile the icon image will be constant, the title of each icon written under it will be text based in order to add and edit the title from the backend, as Im using Joomla 1.5 as the site CMS.\n\nThe project will require two (2) pages:\n\n1. Homepage (landing page), this is where most of the work will be required, as all icons will be stacked and organized with graphical representation for each page.\n\n2. Content page, this is where the content of every page will load, noting that many of the used applications use their own themes and templates. Therefore, only the background of the homepage, including the header, will be used here and a simple graphical navigation icon to take a member back to the homepage should be added.\n\nInitial required icons:\n\n1. My World (members private pages  community page)\n2. Reviews (members reviews page about several travel categories, such as hotels, airlines, etc)\n3. City Guide (listing of cities and travel categories)\n4. Travel Office (flight, hotel and vacation booking)\n5. Trip Planner (trip planner tools, such as calendar, map, notes)\n6. Photos\n7.
