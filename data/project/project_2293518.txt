We rely a lot on technology and most of our trading is (semi-)automated, in other words executed by computer programs that analyze the market.\n\n\nWhat is the exact name you would like in your logo?\nHedgehog (all-caps or all-lowercase variants are ok)\n\n\nYou'll receive designs for biz cards, letterhead and envelopes.\nPriorities of the deliverables are as follows: \n\nThe logo is by far the priority number one. Most of your effort should go into that. A secondary priority to us is the letterhead. Then the business cards, and last the envelopes.\n\n\nWhat is your industry?\nFinance\n\n\nDescribe the target audience for your logo and stationery\nOur target audiences are private investors and institutions. In essence, that means middle-aged, well-educated wealthy men, managing their own or somebody else's wealth.\n\n\nWhat 3 things would you like to communicate to your audience through your logo and stationery?\nIn the eyes of our audience we would like to appear reliable, trustworthy and stable - like banks and other financial companies tend to profile themselves - but on the other hand we would like to signal a certain kind of creative, active, young and vital energy often absent in companies run by dull men in gray suits.\n\nThe market is constantly changing, and as a small company without much bureaucracy overhead we try to be very reactive and respond quickly to changes in the market. This is the uniqueness and strength factor we would like to bring out.\n\n\nWhat logo and stationery styles do you like (text only, image only, text and image, etc.)?\nText and image could work best, but don't be afraid to explore different ideas.\n\n\nWhat colors do you want to see in your logo and stationery?\nLogos of financial companies are often blue, gray and dull. We would like our public image to be in some way warmer, more active. The logo should stand out from the gray mass of other financial companies, but the design should still be rather serious and CLEAN.\n\n\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your logo and stationery?\nPlease use your own judgement.\n\n\nWhat adjectives should best describe your logo and stationery?\nYou can draw inspiration from some or all of these words: reliable, stable, serious, active, reactive, vital, sustainable, growth, wealth, smart, masculine, modern.\n\n\nWhere will your logo be used (print, website, etc.)?\nBoth print and website. A new logo is the first step; the website will be renewed at some later time. With that in mind, setting a good color palette with the logo and stationery is certainly a bonus.\n\n\nDo you have additional info or links you want to share?\nAbout hedgehog the animal... As you can see in the materials section, our old logo includes the animal as a mascot. Using the animal is not discouraged (but not encouraged either). The old logo seems a bit childish or amateurish, and we are looking for a definite improvement on this. \n\nYou may use the idea of the animal for inspiration if you like, but use your own creative judgement on whether you include the animal in some form, maybe just an impression of it, or forget the animal completely. Maybe the spikes are something you could explore, a symbol of a defense mechanism.","description":null,"legacy_brief_sections":[{"questions":[{"legacy_domid":"id_business_name","value":"Hedgehog","label":"Business Name","legacy_field_id":126569,"name":"Business Name"},{"legacy_domid":"id_what_do_you_do","value":"We are a small hedge fund based in Finland that trades stocks, options and other securities using money provided by investors.
