to communicate through your logo?\r\n1. IDENTITY: This financial planning company aligns the risk profiles of affluent clients with customized investment strategies for the highest returns and the fewest taxes. This is not a stodgy corporation or banking subsidiary, but a highly credentialed independent financial advisor who provides well-conceived personalized service.\r\n\r\n2. FEELING: Experienced. Knowledgeable. Approachable. Trustworthy. Creative. Confident. Flexible. Communicative. \r\n\r\n3. TARGETS: High net-worth individuals in the U.S. age 50+, predominantly female, who are seeking better solutions for their wealth, and neophytes who have inherited wealth, and need a smart plan for it to grow.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat logo styles do you like (image + text, image only, text only, etc.)\r\nThis new logo will include a tagline and a mark (unless you can successfully create a remarkable logo with typography alone).\r\n\r\nYour challenge is to create a modern logo that shuns the obvious, and avoids cliche. The design goal is to inspire a feeling of trust, a sense of security, and a wealth of knowledge, without appearing conventional or cold.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have any other info or links you want to share?\r\n\"InWealth\" is one word, with two initial caps, and is the predominant visual element. \"Management\" should get much less emphasis, perhaps tucked into a foundation for InWealth.\r\n\r\nThe tagline is three words plus a period. If English is not your native tongue, it's a play on the phrase \"Game Plan,\" swapping in the word \"Gain\" to say the strategy is to increase a client's wealth through wise investment strategies tailored to one's needs.\r\n\r\nIf you design a mark, it should complement the name and tagline -- NOT define it -- so all three elements interplay to become greater than the sum of their parts. The design should NOT look as if it's promising money (i.e. flying $$$-signs, which would also be axed immediately for being hokey!), since the design will need to be approved up the financial services chain.\r\n\r\nColor choices should be welcoming while instilling confidence -- not overly bright, not bankishly boring. The overall aspect ratio should sit comfortably into a horizontally oriented masthead of an existing template website.\r\n\r\nTO SUMMARIZE: Keep it simple. Zap the obvious. Seek to elicit a reassuring positive emotional response from women and men who are seeking a trustworthy partner to invest their wealth wisely for the long term.\r\n\r\nPlease reread this creative strategy, and understand what we are asking you to design, so you do not waste your time submitting work that is completely off the mark for this client.
