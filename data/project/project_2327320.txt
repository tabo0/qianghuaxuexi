Download hiku free at: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hiku/id508833169?mt=8\n\nThe app's website is at: www.hikuapp.com\nA demo of the app can be found at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARAAux2DJMk&feature=youtu.be\n\n\nWhat is your industry?\nUsers interested in sharing their photos and favorite music with their friends in a socially connected setting.\n\n\nWhat 3 things do you want to communicate to your audience through your app?\n1. Simplicity/Intuitive\n2. Modern clean design\n3. Easy to understand how to find/invite friends to use the app\n\n\nHow many app screens do you need designed?\nThere are six truly unique screens.  However, the \"user\" screen is where settings and user preferences are set which has several screens that are all the same except with very simple variations (such as \"on/off\" buttons).\n\n\nDo your app designs need to be a particular size?\nThe design needs to conform to Apple's User Interface design guidelines which can be found at the website below.\n\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#DOCUMENTATION/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH1-SW1\n\n\nWhat mobile app styles do you like?\nI'm providing the names of the apps I like as well as links to download them.  All the apps below are free to download in Apple's App Store.\n\nPath:\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/app/path/id403639508?mt=8\n\nPinterest:\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pinterest/id429047995?mt=8\n\nInstagram:\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252?mt=8\n\n\nWhat colors do you want to see in your mobile app design?\nI'd like to see a lot of the use of white, especially in the background of areas of the app where user photos will be displayed.  In the current version we have a blue color that washes out the color in pictures posted.  We do like the textured look in our current background and would be open to using texture, but using this or any other texture is not a hard requirement for this project.\n\nWe think the use of more red would be interesting.  Other colors we like: yellow, dark blue.  In general, the color scheme needs to be limited to a few colors that are consistent throughout the look/feel of the UI (much like the examples of apps we like that were provided).\n\n\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your mobile app design?\nDark colors in the background of where user photos are displayed.  Background needs to be white and make the user posted photos \"pop\" off the screen.  No pastel colors please.\n\n\nWhat adjectives should best describe your app design?\nSimple, elegant, modern, intuitive, sleek\n\n\nDo you have additional info or links you'd like to share?\nI am attaching the hiku text logo, the hiku icon we are currently using.  As of now, we plan to continue to use both of these.  Feel free to incorporate the text logo and icon as you see fit but incorporation is not required aside from the exception listed below.  Also below is a link to a variety of \"download on iTunes\" buttons.  Please use either the grey or black English version of this button.\n\n*We'd like to keep the general functional layout of the current UI app because we are restricted to this from a programming perspective.  So you will need to redesign the UI but stay within the existing button framework.  However, buttons that are on the current UI can move anywhere on the screen just as long as the same button options are available on each screen.    \n*Please make sure the hiku text logo is incorporated somewhere in Feed screen.  However, the text logo does not always need to be visible...just when the Feed screen is opened or refreshed.\n*Please incorporate the hiku camera+music note icon into the \"share\" button somehow.\n*Link to \"download on iTunes\" button images: http://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/resources/iTunes-Affiliates-121311.zip","legacy_brief_sections":[{"name":"Business Info","questions":[{"name":"business_name","legacy_field_id":434900,"value":"Sevryn Mobile LLC","label":"Business Name","legacy_domid":"id_business_name"},{"name":"what_you_do","legacy_field_id":434901,"value":"Sevryn Mobile develops mobile apps on the iOS platform.\n\nThis project is a UI redesign of an app currently available in Apple App Store.
