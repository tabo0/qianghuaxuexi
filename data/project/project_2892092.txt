Canned fruit is generally perceived as an old-school, traditional product, so the various packaging designs currently on shelf tend to reflect this. \n\nA winning packaging design for us is something that can stand out against our competitors, but not alienate us on shelf completely. We still need the product to be approachable, with the Malee brand they know and trust, but come across as refreshed and more appealing.\n\nExpected output from this project include:\n- Label designs for each of our 5 products, in 2 label sizes\n- Complete and layered .AI file of each label for internal adaptations and refinements","anything_else":"FRUIT IMAGES\nMango Slices in Light Syrup\n- mango needs to be portrayed in length-wise slices, along with seeing the whole fruit as well\nPinapple Slices in Heavy Syrup\n- full horizontal slices of pinapple (like an O-ring), with whole fruit as well\nPinapple Pieces in Heavy Syrup\n- sliced chunks of pinapple, with whole fruit\nTropical Fruit Cocktail in Heavy Syrup\n- chunks of pinapple, papaya, guava, cherry, _______, presented with or without bowl\nYoung Coconut in Syrup\n- whole green coconut, half cut coconut, showing coconut meat inside the half cut coconut \n\nCOMPETING PRODUCTS\nWe typically see these companies' products next to ours on store shelves, and would like to establish some clear distinction so we can stand out:\n\nDole\nhttps://dolesunshine.com/products/canned-fruit\n\nDel Monte\nhttp://www.delmonte.com/products/fruits\n","top_3":"1.

We are one the largest brands in these categories in Thailand, and we also ship our products to over 30 countries around the world.\n\nWe have been in business for 40 years, working with farmers in Thailand to source the best quality fruits, and make them available in various types of products for our consumers to enjoy.\n\nTARGET AUDIENCE (for canned fruit)\nCustomers who buy our canned fruit products are looking for tropical fruits that they can't find from other brands - namely tropical fruits such as mango, pineapple, lychee, rambutan, amongst others. We have built a strong brand in several markets, which helps Malee serve as a 'trust mark' to ensures quality to our consumers.\n\nThe range of canned fruit products we're asking you to design are sold in our international markets outside of Thailand.\n\nWe have two general target audiences for our canned fruits:\nRETAIL - moms looking to purchase fruits to be served to their families at home, whether it's during snacktime or combined with meals\nFOOD SERVICE - restaurants will use our products as part of their menu items, and some food companies will purchase our products in bulk to use as part of other food products they manufacture","select_fonts":["sans_serif"],"select_colors":[["f44336","4CAF50","2196F3","FFEB3B","673AB7","FF9800","00BCD4","795548","777777"]],"description":"We're an FMCG company looking to update the label design for our canned fruit products.
