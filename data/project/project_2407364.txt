The idea is that club managers may register their clubs to enter their details as well as upload images of their clubs. Our platform then uses this data and the images to create a mini website for each club.\n\nThe goal is that visitors are browsing our platform by scrolling through the sedcards or searching by specific criteria to find clubs they might be interested in. When a visitor clicks on a sedcard we present the clubs mini website in a new browser tab. \n\nWe expect designers to provide design proposals for the sedcard as well as the mini website.\n\nStructure of the Sedcard\n\nPlease use the existing girl sedcards (fun6.ch) as a basis.

We imagine a header section holding the key facts like name, address, telephone and kind of club, followed by sections housing the details and images.
