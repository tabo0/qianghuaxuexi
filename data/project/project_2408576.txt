Our major customer group is aged 50+ and 80% of our customers are male.\r\nThe product we require a sales letter designed for is a natural prostate health product aimed at men in the 50+ age group.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many pages of print design do you need?\r\n4 pages - 3 of text and one an order form page\r\n\r\n\r\nList the size requirement(s) for your print design\r\nA4 size.\r\nUK based company and this is a standard size in the UK.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is your industry?\r\n Health Care and Biotech\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe the target audience for your print design\r\nMen aged 50+\r\nThey are literate and intelligent.\r\nMost have a high disposable income, but need persuading to part with their money. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat 3 things would you like to communicate to your audience through your print design?\r\nThere are slightly more than 3 things we would like to communicate through the print design. Here is a bullet list of what we feel a design should communicate and achieve:\r\nGrab attention\r\nHold attention\r\nCreate desire\r\nShow benefits\r\nConvey Natural/Effective/Credible\r\nHave zero obstructions to a reader wanting to phone or post an inquiry or order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat print design styles do you like?\r\nWe have no specific design styles in mind. However, an information leaflet has been designed and completed. This will be accompanying the letter being designed here. So the letter design will need to compliment and reflect the design of the leaflet. PDF files of the leaflet have been attached below.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat colors do you want to see in your print design?\r\nPrimarily green. The colours used in the accompanying leaflet all work for us. Colours associated with positive views of natural are probably best.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your print design?\r\nI can't think of any to exclude. I don't wish to limit the designers.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat adjectives should best describe your print design?\r\nPositive - Natural - Effective - Safe\r\n\r\n\r\nHow will you use the print design?\r\nThe print design is for a sales letter which will be directly mailed to potential customers. These customers have NOT previously purchased from us and may not even know we exist. It is vital the design grab attention so the direct mail pack will not end in the bin immediately. A leaflet giving the main, plain information about the product will accompany the sales letter being designed here. PDF files of the leaflet are included in the attached files.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat content must be included in the print design?\r\nThe letter must give a sense of the product being natural, safe and effective.\r\nSince it is a text driven letter the use of colors, the layout and font styles will have to be used to create the required effect in the reader.\r\nThe letter design should draw the receiver to read it and the layout should have a good flow so the reader finds the letter easy to read.\r\nA slightly larger font size than usual may be required, as many of the readers will be over 60 and may have eyesight issues.\r\nThe design and layout are the key considerations initially. The letter text is provided, but it may take time to import the text into the design as well as creating a letter layout/design. To help make the initial part easier, we will accept design ideas where place holder text is used (i.e. lorum ipsum - Rather than copy pasting the actual supplied text).\r\nImages will have a part to play in the design. However, having images which support and reinforce the points in the text is more important than just having lots of images. A few good images are more important than a lot of images which seem there just for the sake of it.\r\nPage 1  Company name/logo top centre with new tag line replacing existing tag line.
