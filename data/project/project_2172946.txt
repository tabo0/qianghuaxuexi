After months of kitchen design and redesign the bus is being built! A full kitchen on the bottom, with rooftop dining open air! Bar Counter height granite tables and granite counters around the railing it will be the place to eat. Lounge music and soft white LED lighting under the tables. \r\n\r\nThe bus is going to be launched in Los Angeles and we want it to be a place to have a great meal with like minded people, the bus is going to bring people together through different flavors, textures of our international dishes. We are taking the best of global dishes and making them available through our Chef's interpretation on these specialties. Great food is a cornerstone of what we are doing and integral to the success and branding of the concept. The bus: timeless, non pretentious, streets of LA.\r\n\r\nVisit our website at www.worldfare.com to get a sense of the project as a whole.  The design of the website does not necessarily represent the design direction we want.  Watch building the bus, watch the stop motion for a feel of the bus in its current form http://worldfare.com/about/bus-build .  \r\n\r\nThe upstairs deck will have a black floor, white granite counters going around the outside of the bus so people can stand and eat and socialize.\r\n\r\nThere will be 3 umbrellas on the rooftop deck please see images of umbrellas below.\r\n\r\nThe sides of the bus will be lit at night with Halogen lights, we definitely want striking images and bold colors.  \r\n\r\nThe Skin wrap of the bus needs to make a statement tell a story at the very least it needs to depict something worldly and something to do with food, it is a double sided billboard that will be the first thing that gets people interested in the bus.  It will define the brand story.\r\n\r\nWe are really excited about this business and brand we are trying to create and we can't wait to see some exciting ideas from the www.crowdspring.community that hopefully can become our first mobile restaurant.\r\n\r\nHERE IS WHAT WE NEED:\r\n\r\nWe need an initial design for the full wrap of the bus, a side view can be presented firstly with maybe the wrap on the front as per bus image view below.  This needs to tell the brand story and vision.  It is important that this image needs \r\n\r\nThere will be no windows on the side of the bus so the design can be a flat design all the way along the side.  \r\n\r\nFirstly a design concept will be chosen based on the design concept   On project award we will  need artwork for the full die lines that are given.  We need this in high resolution as we will be making this the size of the bus.  \r\n\r\nOUR TARGET AUDIENCE IS:\r\n\r\nWe have 3 major customers, Professionals, 25-50 hard working want to grab a good lunch but they just want to step out the building to get it. 11am - 3pm Event catering - same audience as above the bus is mobile and will create the event. Possible Bar and DJ on the top deck, kitchen serving food below. Late Night Club/Bar Crowd, 21 - 40 party goers leaving the bar and club who want the night to continue and have some great food.\r\n\r\nWE LIKE THESE DESIGNS:\r\n\r\nPlease see image of World Fare logo that was chosen from a previous Crowdspring project.  This is attached in images below. \r\n\r\nWE ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE (or we don't want to see) THIS IN OUR DESIGN:\r\n\r\nAt this point we are open to all ideas.","legacy_brief_sections":[],"description":null},"brief_questions":[{"validations":["required"],"help":"","label":"Summarize your project.","name":"description","type":"textarea","answer_label":"Project Summary","description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
