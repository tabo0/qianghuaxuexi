We did a wireframe and gave it to someone to design. We think it came out as an acceptable version.  However, we want to develop an exceptional website and thought opening the design up to more participants would accomplish this goal.  \n\nWe like the home hero image and the video area underneath and want that to remain consistent.  We would be open to any different presentation, font, colors, or use of the image that you think could improve the design.  \n\nSince everyone who comes to the site has a specific practice area applicable to them, the biggest challenge of the site is to present all the practice areas in a way where visitors can easily find and see their issue, identify with it, and click on it to get them to a page that will speak more directly to them.  So the presentation of all these practice areas in a clear way is very vital to conversions on the site.  The winner will find a way to use cutting edge web design and development practices to utilize.  We would at least need to have the three categories of criminal defense:  Federal, State, DUI (please put them in that order) clearly visible with the videos, like on the wireframe.  As you can see, we only have a button on the state crimes that would break out the different types of crimes, but that is not acceptable and we didn’t know how to alter the existing design without completely redesigning the area.  \n\nWe will not have pages for all the practice areas to start so they may have to go to a “Federal” page where we list them all again, but focused on federal.  \n\nThe same thing applies to the mobile home page.  Over 60% of visitors come on a mobile phone so this is almost more important than the desktop home.   I can’t see the same system working on a mobile page that is used on the desktop so the same thing about creativity applies to this also.  \n\nNeed to add:  “Call 24 Hours”\n\nHere is the desktop home page wireframe we put together so far: \n\nhttp://growingyouragency.com/stechschulte-nell/02-home-practice.html\n\nFederal Crimes\n\nDrug Trafficking\nConspiracy\nWire FraudMail Fraud\nGovernment Center Fraud\nKickbacks\nBribery\nWhistleblower Fraud\nHealthcare Fraud\nMedicare Fraud\nFirearms \nFederal Gun Crimes\nSelling Guns without license\nCheck Forgery\nIdentity Theft\nRICO – Racketeering\nImmigration Crimes\nIllegal Re-entry\nSocial Security Fraud\nTax Fraud\nWire Fraud\nFederal Sex Crimes\n\nState Crimes\n\nTheft\nMurder\nDrug Crimes\nDomestic Violence\nAssault\nEmbezzlement\nProbation Violation\nSex Crimes\n\tChild Pornography\n\tStatutory Rape\nDate Rape\n\tLewd and lecivious\nFailure to report\nJuvenile Crimes\nAppeals\nExpungement\nTraffic Crimes\n\nDUI\n\nAct Immediately to Get Your License Back\nImportance of a Private Attorney\n3 Steps to Defending a DUI\n"},{"title":"State Crimes Internal Page","description":"This will be the landing page for those looking for representation on state crimes.  It will serve as the template for all internal pages. As you can see, we still want the same header and main video on the page since any page can easily be the first page visitors see.  \n\nHere is the design we have so far.  \n\nhttp://growingyouragency.com/stechschulte-nell/02-inner-page.html\n"},{"title":"Blog Page","description":"http://growingyouragency.com/stechschulte-nell/02-blog.html"},{"title":"Mobile Home","description":"As you can see, we will have a different header area for the mobile site.  We do not want to have just a desktop site broken apart and put horizontally like most mobile responsive sites.  If we can’t figure out how to develop the site to change the header area on a phone, we will have a completely different mobile site.  \n\nHere is what we have right now for the mobile home page:\n\nhttp://growingyouragency.com/stechschulte-nell/01-mobile-A.html\n\nhttp://growingyouragency.com/stechschulte-nell/01-mobile-B.html\n\nWe would like the concept close to what is there, but something about it did not work perfectly.  \n\nAnd, again, we would like to see creative ways of presenting the practice areas.  Right now they are just breakouts, but anything new that looks good an easy to navigate would go a long way toward winning the award.\n\nThe bottom part of the mobile site can be much like the desktop site broken apart and displayed vertically.  \n\nSticky header – once the mobile visitor starts scrolling, we would like to see there be a header at the top that does not scroll away.  It needs to have the logo, menu bars, “Free Case Review”, phone number and something to indicate a button to press for directions on Google Maps. \n\n http://growingyouragency.com/stechschulte-nell/01-mobile-sticky-header.html\n"},{"title":"Mobile Internal Page","description":"This will have to use the same header area as the home page since the internal pages often serve as landing pages.
