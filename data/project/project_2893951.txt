People will be able to buy anything from\nflea spray to high end dog coats. The focus is on improving the life of your pets.\nHappierPets is launching an online pet store. We want to be different from our competitors by\nhaving some personality rather than just being a standard ecommerce site. We want people to feel\nthis site cares about pets and offers a high level of service and knowledge. As well as stocking\nmainstream pet products, we’ll also stock products that focus on both the pets body and mind. This\napproach sets apart from the market.\nWe want to offer the customer a fun shopping experience, different from what they would find with\nother pet stores – this is key the word “fun”. We’re making a bold play in this sector, so the site design\nneeds to be fun and bold and one that people recognise.\nWe want to stock a wide range of products some of which users can buy elsewhere - so they need\na reason to 'buy in' to our brand and buy from us rather than a boring ecommerce site.\nOur target market are pet owners of all ages. People who love their pets as a member of their family.","anything_else":"This competition is for 2 pages. If you win this competition, there will be roughly 6 more pages we will ask you to design on a 1-to-1 project. \nWe have provided our logo – this may help with colour palette. Please note, we have also attached a JPEG showing the logo we want to use. The Zip file contains different formats.\nOur site is aimed equally at men and women, of all age groups. The site needs to look professional, bright, trustworthy and fun. \n\nFor reference, these competitors are of interest;\nhttps://fetch.co.uk/\nand\nhttps://www.jollyes.co.uk/\n\njollyes.co.uk\nWhat we like: It’s bright and clean.\nWhat we’re less keen on: the constant blocky offers are a bit dazzling to the eye\n\nfetch.co.uk\nWhat we like: Succeeds in creating a feeling for the brand. There is personality in the colours, the font and imagery used. There is a feeling of depth, and you feel there are real people running this site and that it’s not just about selling stuff. There is a modern but premium feel to the site and you get the feeling they know a lot about their market (dogs).\nWhat we’re less keen on: Although the layout is clean, this homepage goes further towards big brand display than we want - big splash areas utilising a lot of space. It’s not a traditional ecommerce site which is good for a big brand like this owned by Ocado. We need to take the elements of their approach that work but you can see from our wireframes that our layout for homepage is a little more ecommerce than this. Fetch looks more premium\n\n\n\nExample of a site we don’t like:\n\nzooplus.co.uk - although this is a successful site, there is no personality, the colour palette is bland. That might work for a pet superstore but our site needs to have more character.\nWe have attached Wireframes for the relevant pages to be designed. You can attach place holders where the images should be. (When choosing your place holder, try to use something relevant as it will affect the overall look and feel of the site.)\n--\n\nNOTE: The wire frame is not to scale. We are not sure if we have the exact padding correct. You will need to use your own judgement. \n\n","add_pages":[{"title":"Home Page"},{"title":"TOP Level Category Page"}],"top_3":"Fun, Caring, Trustworthy.","site_features":[{"icon":"none","description":"None of these.","label":"None"}],"website_success":"A successful design to us is one that Increases sales and brings the customer back time and time again.","company":"HappierPets will be the pet wellbeing destination website.
