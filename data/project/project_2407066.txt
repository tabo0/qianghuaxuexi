We focus mainly on urban projects, but not \"downtown\" - we look cool neighborhood. Strong supporter of arts, and try to incorporate unique art into every project we do. We avoid the suburbs and try not to appear to suburban in the work that we do. \n\n\nHow many pages of print design do you need?\nmultiple pages\n\n\nList the size requirement(s) for your print design\nWhat I'm picturing initially is help with a marketing brochure - but sort of the \"base\" design. We would then want to take the design and add pages to the brochure as needed, use as a design plan for a website, possible digital ads, etc. \n\n\nWhat is your industry?\n Real Estate and Construction\n\n\nDescribe the target audience for your print design\nWe are starting construction on a 200,000 sf tenant in an urban area of Minneapolis called Uptown. The project is MoZaic East, the second phase of a larger development. The marketing will be geared towards the tenants we are hoping to attract. The tenants we are currently targeting are tech companies, marketing/design companies, urban co-working concepts, etc. Uptown is a great alternative to traditional \"downtown\" office space - no suites and ties, great access to restaurants/bars, lakes blocks away, access to a huge bike path in the city that is very popular, etc. Tends to appeal to entrepreneurs that have been successful and now have large businesses, but don't want to feel corporate. Feedback thus far has been it is a place that employees want to work, which is driving company relocation - so think 20-30-40 year old white color professionals that don't wear suits and don't work traditional office hours.\n\n\nWhat 3 things would you like to communicate to your audience through your print design?\nWe need it to be professional, but without being corporate. \nTech and Design companies looking to lease space from us need to feel like we \"get it\" - so design needs to feel strong to them. \nShould feel urban without feeling too gritty.\n\n\nWhat print design styles do you like?\nSorry, i don't really know how to answer this\n\n\nWhat colors do you want to see in your print design?\nProbably black and white as a possibility. Our corporate colors are royal purple and lime green ish, but I'm not sure that would look very good. We love red (chakras). The property has a blue in the logo that will not be changed (it's on permanent signage for phase 1)\n\n\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your print design?\nPastels. \n\n\nWhat adjectives should best describe your print design?\nCool, urban, raw, sleek, modern\n\n\nHow will you use the print design?\nthe initial piece will be a PDF brochure. We have one now that is boring. If we have a base design we like, we then likely will also build a property specific website. Digital ads on real estate sites might also be utilized, as an email campaign. Possibly letterhead. Likely some construction fencing/signage at the site. \n\n\nWhat content must be included in the print design?\nName is MoZaic East, and it is specifically written - \"o\" in blue, Z is capitalized. Ackerberg logo, and CBRE logo need to be included. The brochure will need to include charts/graphs, written copy, renderings, and floor plans - but I'm not expecting anyone to actually build all of that, just help me understand visually what the overall pages might look like, and then we would work through dropping text and things in. I will be uploading the current boring brochure, called MoZaic east. I will also upload some of the older marketing materials for the first phase, a current rendering of the new project, and some info about the art plaza we created that will connect this new phase to the original phase.","legacy_brief_sections":[{"name":"Business Info","questions":[{"name":"business_name","legacy_field_id":1249844,"value":"Ackerberg","label":"Business Name","legacy_domid":"id_business_name"},{"name":"what_do_you_do","legacy_field_id":1249845,"value":"We do commercial real estate.
