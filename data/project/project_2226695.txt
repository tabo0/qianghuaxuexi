And it seems to turn out right these days. His Remixes find full support from the biggest global players and his own stuff earns massive reaction on the floors and in the current music scene.\r\n\r\nChris was born and raised in Zurich, Switzerland. In the early nineties he experimented with computers and came into making electronic music. Together with Franky Fonell he launched the Spiritgroove-Studio back in 1997. They produced together for almost a decade. They can take credits for projects like Seashells (Sirup Records), Basic Dawn (Difuse Records), DJ Energy (Nukleuz) and many others. The time they have spent in the Swiss single charts alone adds up to a total of over 70 weeks.\r\n\r\nThe biggest development in Chris's career came when he felt he had done all he could with the uplifting trance sound he'd been tagged with and became enthused with the underground, tribal & progressive house sound.\r\n\r\n2007 Chris launched his own digital label Unreleased Digital. International artists like Daniel Portman or Dinka are signed exclusively to this label, next to the Chris Reece project itself.\r\n\r\n2008 started with some big new remixes and a release on Thomas Pentons label Electric Candy in March 2008.\r\nHis remixes on Dobenbeck's  Please Dont Go (Sirup/Armada), Swen Webers  The Pusher (Swentraxx) or Three Drives  Greece 2000 (Pinkstar Records) have been released recently with big reactions already from the biggest DJs around the globe.\r\n\r\nA new EP is ready to be released over Unreleased Digital mid June 2008, its called Tribal Solution. \r\n\r\nChristian is the guy behind the Music and the vibe, Roberto is taking care of the gigs around the globe. Togetehr they have a very great feel for complementary dance music.\r\n\r\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/inbox/?ref=mb#/chrisreeceproject?v=wall&ref=ts\r\nMyspace: http://www.myspace.com/donchrisreece\r\n\r\n\r\nHERE IS WHAT WE NEED:\r\n\r\nWe need a brand new logo with Icon, that we can use as logo-type only, with icon and icon stand alone version.
