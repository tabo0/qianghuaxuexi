One notch above metrosexual and one notch below caveman. Concerned about style. People who go to uncrate.com or similar. Education would be college educated. Not too serious but not goofy at all. Pre-fatherhood  but post-high-school letterman. \n\n\nWhat are the top 3 things you would like to communicate through your logo?\nWords I wrote down include classic, hidden, subtle. I want the customers to feel that this online-store is minimalist. The products for sale aren't corny. \n\n\nWhat logo styles do you like (text only, image only, text and image, etc.)?\nLogos/Images that I like  include RTH in Los Angeles,   Aseop prada (may be a bit too minimal). Text + Image would be better. Things to include in image would be an elephant. (yeah, I know, you guys are the creative ones not me.... try to work it in). \nI do not like Herschel supply (too classic) \n\n\nWhat colors do you want to see in your logo?\nGray/Charcoal/Black. Dark Blue Spectrum. \nAny of the above or combination. Whatever looks best. \n\n\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your logo?\nYellow, Red. White. \n\n\nWhere will your logo be used (print, website, etc.)?\nThe logo will MAINLY be used for the header in the website & packaging (See attached image of RTH design) I may make a tshirt out of it... it depends I suppose :) \n\n\nDo you have other info or links you want to share?\nAs far as images go. Elephant, also consider vintage hot-air balloon. Look at the attached images. \nExtract what you want from the design elements and go with it. \nAS far as text goes No Cursive please. I like simple clear print. I don't want a vintage print from the 30's.... something modern and clean.","legacy_brief_sections":[{"name":"Business Info","questions":[{"name":"Business Name","legacy_field_id":129917,"value":"I Am Mine","label":"Business Name","legacy_domid":"id_business_name"},{"name":"What is the exact name you would like in your logo?","legacy_field_id":129918,"value":"I Am Mine","label":"What is the exact name you would like in your logo?","legacy_domid":"id_exact_name_in_logo"}],"label":"Business Info","legacy_field_id":129916},{"name":"Target Audience","questions":[{"name":"What is your industry?","legacy_field_id":129920,"value":"TShirt/Clothing/Nick Nacks","label":"What is your industry?","legacy_domid":"id_your_industry"},{"name":"Describe the target audience for your logo","legacy_field_id":129921,"value":"Target Audience Men aged 25-35.
