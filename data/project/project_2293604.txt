We have been in business for over 50 years and have published many top speakers/authors such as: Tony Robbins, Wayne Dyer, Marianne Williamson, Robert Kiyosaki, Brian Tracy, Larry Winget, Deepak Chopra, Gregg Braden,and Ric Edelman. We publish high-end programs in the price range between $39.95 and $299.95. Our website is www.nightingale.com. \n\n\n\nHow many pages of print design do you need?\n1\n\n\nList the size requirement(s) for your print design\nThe specs of the cover are 6.5 inches x 6.5 inches \n\nAlso, provide any files to us in Quark or Photoshop formats.\n\n\nWhat is your industry?\nAudio Publishing\n\n\nDescribe the target audience for your print design\n60% male; 40% female. \n\n*Upper middle income to high income consumers; average household income of $85K and up. \n\n*Well educated consumer; 75% have bachelors degrees, and 30% have some advanced education (graduate school, executive training, etc.) \n\n*Success and personal growth oriented consumers who are leaders and who prefer to \"move towards\" positive outcomes vs. \"move away from\" negative outcomes. \n\n*Middle aged consumers who are interested in keeping their brain healthy, active and alert to continue to compete in their jobs and businesses and contribute to their larger community through their senior years. \n\n*We want our customers to think of Nightingale-Conant as a high-end, premium priced publisher, who distributes life changing ideas. We are looking to position the content as unique, different and \"exclusive\"----so it is not compared to the vast amounts of audio content available on the web (to avoid looking at the product as a \"commodity.\") To make a comparison, if we were in the chocolate business we want our customers to think of Nightingale-Conant, and by extension, this program, as the Godiva (gold wrapped gourmet chocolate experience)----not as Hershey's! \n\n\n\nWhat 3 things would you like to communicate to your audience through your print design?\nRelaxation, Optimism,\"High-end\",\"Polished\" and \"Multi-Colored\" design \n\n\n\n\nWhat print design styles do you like?\nAnything but grey; soft, flowing colors that are \"easy on the eye\", not too dark. \n\n\n\nWhat colors do you want to see in your print design?\nAnything but grey; soft, flowing colors that are \"easy on the eye\", not too dark. \n\n\n\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your print design?\nGrey or black\n\n\nWhat adjectives should best describe your print design?\nColorful, soft, feels like an \"easy/lazy, stressfree day.\"\n\n\nHow will you use the print design?\nFor an audio program cover.\n\n\nWhat content must be included in the print design?\nWe need a creative cover design for a 6 CD + workbook audio program called: \n\nMain Title: Brain Massage 2.0\nSubtitle: A \"Deep Tissue\" Treatment For Your Mind \nAuthor: by The Relaxation Company (use their logo)\n\nThe Main title should be larger than the subtitle. The author's name must appear on the cover as well. \n\nWe need the file to be delivered in a format (Quark or Photoshop) that can be adapted and edited by our creative team. \n\nTo stimulate ideas for the cover, here is a concept which details the main ideas in the Brain Massage 2.0 program: \n\nBRAINWAVE MASSAGE 2.0\nProposal for Nightingale Conant\n\nThis new project is a sequel to Brainwave Massage (see attached prior program cover). The concept is basically the same: Simply listen to the CD of your choice to stimulate your own brainwaves to produce the state of mind you want to experience.\n\n\tThe original Brainwave Massage set had 4 CDs of ambient music by Dr. Thompson and 4 CDs of classical music. For this set, we propose 4 CDs of ambient music and 4 CDs of natural soundscapes processed by Dr. Thompson with embedded brainwave scores. Review samples of each recording are on order for you.\n\n\tNone of the CDs for the sequel have been used in the original Brainwave Massage set, Awakened Mind set, or Delta Sleep Solution set.\n\n\tWe are envisioning that you would sell this set at the same price as the original Brainwave Massage but rather than offering a single CD as a free bonus CD, we would work with you so that you can offer 3 free bonus CDs. We will offer you the same cost as the original set  allowing you to pass on a significant value and hopefully making this sequel even more successful than the original. The bonus CDs can be from other artists  each with a unique mind technology.\n\nThe 8CD set includes:\n\nGamma Meditation\nDr.Thompson used brain research done in conjunction with the Dali Lamas as the basis for this powerful meditation program.\n\nHealing Mind\nListeners access their inner source of physical, emotional and spiritual healing.\n\nAmbient Music for Sleep\nFall asleep, stay asleep, wake up rejuvenated.\n\nAlpha Relaxation\nThe alpha brainwave reflects a state of deep but alert relaxation. The listener can use this as background during waking activities.\n\nSleepy Rain\nThe soothing sounds of a gentle rain in the distance are processed with Dr. Thompsons delta brainwave technologies.\n\nMeditative Stream\nA flowing, trickling brook is the timeless background for theta pulses to induce a meditative state.\n\nAwakened Rainforest\nThe lush, tropical sounds of the jungle are embedded with the awakened mind brainwave pattern for peak performance in many domains.\n\nSongbird Sunrise\nChirps and melodic bits of morning songbirds bring on an awakened and relaxed state.\n\nBonus CD:\n\nDavid Ison  Sleep Music used by U.S. Army.","legacy_brief_sections":[{"name":"Business Info","questions":[{"name":"Business Name","legacy_field_id":127847,"value":"Nightingale-Conant Corporation","label":"Business Name","legacy_domid":"id_print_design_name"},{"name":"What do you do?","legacy_field_id":127848,"value":"Nightingale-Conant is the world's largest publisher of personal and spiritual growth audio programs.
