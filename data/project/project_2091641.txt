The good news is that the business 'works, the bad news is that we're still using poor IP.  Help!\r\n\r\nThe logo should be text based, using the name Plouton.  We currently include the word 'consulting' underneath the word 'Plouton' to emphasis our business skill-set, and we also use a red diamond (kite shape) to highlight our industry.  Neither of these are mandatory, but designs that retain elements of our current IP will always be well received.  Completely new ideas will be carefully examined but only accepted if they really get us excited!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERE IS WHAT WE NEED:\r\n\r\n1. A logo\r\n2. A business card template\r\n3. A microsoft word letter template\r\n4. A microsoft powerpoint slide template\r\n5. The logo will be used on a web-site, though this is not part of this specific brief and may come later via www.crowdspring.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR TARGET AUDIENCE IS:\r\n\r\nOur clients range from mining houses to governments to manufacturers to retailers.  The industry is generally very traditional and our clients expect us to wear a suit and tie at meetings - however we are not old-fashioned so the logo should reflect this and be contemporary, perhaps by integrating a modern 'device' (currently the red diamond) on traditional typography (though please don't treat that as mandatory!).\r\n\r\nAbove all we are creative thinkers, and creativity/ideas/new ways of looking at problems is what we do - we'd like a logo to encapsulate this but in a way that still portrays us as entirely professional when our business card hits the desk of a government minister or Chief Executive.  In other words we have a knowledgeable and powerful, though conservative, clientbase. \r\n\r\n\r\nWE LIKE THESE DESIGNS:\r\n\r\nWe'd like to leave this blank for now as we don't want to restrict the ideas.  Depending on what comes through, we may update this if the ideas are going in the wrong direction.\r\n\r\nWE ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE (or we don't want to see) THIS IN OUR DESIGN:\r\n\r\nWe'd like a strong typeface driven logo that focusses on the name Plouton.  If you feel it necessary, please do integrate the word 'consulting' or 'luxury consulting' and design a 'device' (currently based on a red -web safe colour 99000- diamond shape).\r\n\r\nWe believe the winning idea will be simpler, rather than complex in look.\r\n\r\nPlouton should probably have a capital letter (though not mandatory), but we're not fussed by serif vs san serif.\r\n\r\nWe've attached a pdf of the current (embarrasing) logo - it has a line underneath explaining the the name Plouton's ancient greek origins.  This will almost certainly be dropped!","description":null,"legacy_brief_sections":[]},"brief_questions":[{"description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
