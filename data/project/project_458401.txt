If desired we also emboss the customers name or any other text onto the products. Special and off-beat wishes will be fulfilled too, so we expect that nearly every product will be more or less unique.\r\n\r\nOur main focus is providing top quality products beyond any doubts and a fully costumer oriented service. We know the word customer service is often used as a marketing catchword but we mean it! Maybe you have heard of Mass Customization before, Open Innovation surely is a household name for you. Just like on crowdSPRING everybody can put improvement suggestions up for discussion and we try to implement them. We believe that Open Innovation is the future and that customers should have the chance to be more involved in the design of their products!\r\n\r\nWe chose \"Tanner & Tailor\" as brand name because it symbolizes that every product is made to order by real craftsmen. A tanner is the person who processes the leather and a tailor is the one who sews up exactly what you want.\r\n\r\nHERE IS WHAT WE NEED:\r\n\r\nEven though the customer can have his own name or phrase embossed onto the product, we still need a brand logo. The idea is to use this logo as a metal pendant which is attached to the zipper puller or hung onto the product with a leather string. Additionally we also would like to use it on the packaging, e.g. the boxes and wrapping. For this purposes the logo should be remarkable and clear.\r\n\r\nOUR TARGET AUDIENCE IS:\r\n\r\nEveryone who doesn't want to wear and use the same similar mass products but to express his own style and ideas.\r\n\r\nWe dont want to appeal to young women solely but basically to men and women of every age. For the start we have both fashionable and more classic products, so everybody should find something suitable. But even if not, our site is about designing products according to own wishes... ;-)\r\n\r\nWE LIKE THESE DESIGNS:\r\n\r\nSleek, chic, elegant","legacy_brief_sections":[],"description":null},"brief_questions":[{"description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
