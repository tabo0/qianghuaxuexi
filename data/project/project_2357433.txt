Lots of opportunity for creativity and whimsy - please help!!","legacy_brief_text":"Business Name\r\nSecret Bubblers\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you do?\r\nSecret Bubblers is a Christmas adventure for kids that encourages kindness.  The piece we need to have designed is the instructions for parents that go in the adventure set.  \r\n\r\nThis is an adventure/program that parents will buy around Christmas. The set includes a letter (draft attached) that parents read to their child from Ozzie, the Great Grand Elf of the Microscopic Elves.  The child learns that they've been selected for a special mission - to help a Microscopic Elf make it to Santa's workshop.  The only way these elves can make it to the North Pole is through the kind acts of a child.  More info attached - that's the premise.  \r\n\r\n\r\nHow many pages of print design do you need?\r\nWe'd like a two-sided 8.5x11 sheet that folds in half so it's a four panel booklet.\r\n\r\n\r\nList the size requirement(s) for your print design\r\nThe final document should be half sheet sized (8.5 x 5.5 inches) - I think it will look best done in vertical - with the logo and overview on the front (if it all fits) and the other info inside.  If the back page isn't needed for the content, it can just have the logo and website.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is your industry?\r\nPublishing and Media\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe the target audience for your print design\r\nThis will be included in the adventure kit for parents of kids that are between 4 and 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat 3 things would you like to communicate to your audience through your print design?\r\nThe most important part of this design is laying it out in a way that makes the directions as easy to digest as possible.  Ideally, the front is just the overview for the program - the inside is the directions.  It's a lot of information so any visual elements that can be used to make it look elegant and easy to understand would be very appreciated.  \r\n\r\nIt needs to be clear, elegant and slightly whimsical.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat print design styles do you like?\r\nI've attached a mock up of the main element of the adventure - an illustrated letter that parents read to a child.  That gives you an idea of the style of the program.  The instructions don't need to be as elaborate - but they should be elegant with a touch of whimsy.  There are also illustrations that could be added, if appropriate, to the instructions - the two that might work well are the bubbles with the elves in them, and or the little girl blowing bubbles.\r\n\r\nGoudy Old Style can be used for regular copy - the letter from Ozzie has Jim Nightshade as the main feature, with custom drop caps.  \r\n\r\nIt would be great if these instructions could feel fun and whimsical and still be easy to digest.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat colors do you want to see in your print design?\r\n\r\nLogo: The colors are currently set as Pantone (spot) colors, this should be left as-is when placed into the design.\r\n\r\nOther colors: palette attached. Only the purple should be used as a spot (PMS) color. For all the other colors, the CMYK values should be used. Text should be set in the dark charcoal color rather than black.\r\n\r\nA MAX OF 6 COLORS SHOULD BE USED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your print design?\r\nPalette of color options is attached.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat adjectives should best describe your print design?\r\nClear, elegant, whimsical.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow will you use the print design?\r\nIncluded in the adventure kit.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat content must be included in the print design?\r\nSee attached document entitled Bubblers Overview and directions FINAL","legacy_brief_sections":[{"label":"Business Info","legacy_field_id":750547,"questions":[{"value":"Secret Bubblers","label":"Business Name","legacy_field_id":750548,"legacy_domid":"id_business_name","name":"business_name"},{"value":"Secret Bubblers is a Christmas adventure for kids that encourages kindness.
