Male dominated industry.\n\n\nWhat 3 things would you like to communicate to your audience through your logo and stationery?\nProfessional - the used car industry has a lot of negative connotations coming from shady corner lot dealers and cheesy/misleading marketing.  This needs to convey the polar opposite of the sleazy used car sales technique.  This site is only for franchise dealerships, ie Honda, Toyota, Ford - no \"Joe's used car lot\".  \n\nClean/Simple/Easy - the business is all online and I want the logo design to reflect the site's simplicity and ease of use.

I am going for 2 or 3 at the most.  I like greys and blues but do not want to rule anything out.  Honestly, I have no idea what colors work well with others, so be creative but keep it simple.  Maybe subdued colors with highlights of some bright color rather than a bunch of colors all thrown in there.  I would rather have the professional look than the playful wow color factor.
