Once this media kit is completed, we will do a separate project for each of the 4 events. Hopefully using the same creative for all 5 projects. \n\nPlease watch this 2-minute video from our last event that will give you the feel that we are going for https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdpVlwfbejQ ","anything_else":"This media kit will be an overview of 4 events we have coming up. The four (4) events are: \n1. Lemonhaze expo and budtender party – Portland – Sponsorship cost $2500 \na. Date – July 19th \nb. Location – Melody Ballroom, Portland OR \n2. Lemonhaze Block Party – Seattle’s Georgetown Neighborhood – Sponsorship Cost $2000 \na. Date – Sunday August 5 \nb. Location – The Stables, Georgetown neighborhood in Seattle WA \n3. Lemonhaze Up-fronts and budtender party – Spokane - $4000 \na. Date – Thursday September 20th \nb. Location – The Glover Mansion – Spokane WA \n4. Lemonhaze Cannabis Convention – Washington - $2,000-$20,000 \na. Date – Thursday and Friday Oct 25-26 \nb. Location – The Tacoma Dome – Tacoma WA \nDefinitions of events (These definitions are to be used by creatives to use in their explanations and marketing. These definitions are not meant to be used as copy unless they are cleaned up and not written so much in the vernacular) \n· Expo – Brands set up booths where they can display how their products are packaged, explain how they are grown or processed, and basically to educate the attendees about the sponsors product. \n· Budtender party – Lemonhaze throws large parties that are provided completely free to the budtenders, buyers, managers, and owners of cannabis retailers and dispensaries. They are open bar, free food, live entertainment and free swag provided to the attendees. Sponsors attend these parties to spend time and network with the budtender and buyers of the cannabis retailers and dispensaries. The reason the sponsors want to do this is because the retail buyer buys the sponsors products from the sponsor and the budtender sells the sponsors product to the public. The more product that the budtender sells to the public, then they more product the buyer buys from the sponsor. \n· Up-fronts – the Up-fronts are scheduled times during Lemonhaze events in which the sponsor is given 15 minutes and a location to meet with a buyer from a cannabis retailer or dispensary. During that 15 minutes the sponsor talks about and educates the buyer on the sponsors product and they discuss price for wholesale sales. Once the 15 minutes are up the buyers move to the next sponsor and start another 15-minute meeting. Think of “speed dating” for businesses. \n· Lemonhaze Cannabis Convention – This will be the first “Lemonhaze Cannabis Convention”. It will bring thousands of people from the industry by providing meetings, b2b, seminars, education, entertainment, and a trade show. \no The reason any companies should sponsor Lemonhaze Convention is because we guarantee that there will be more people from the industry in attendance than any other show in the country. The reason we will have more industry attendees than anyone else is because we will provide: \n§ An expo of a majority of all the WA cannabis brands \n§ Free medical training to retailers that send their buyers to up-fronts that are being held at convention \n§ Big name entertainment acts. Acts are TBD (to be determined), but they will include either famous comedians or famous singers. \n§ Up fronts will be held at convention \n§ Halloween themed budtender party will close the convention \n§ Specific cocktail parties only for sponsors and owners, managers, and buyers of cannabis retailers. ","top_3":"1. Lemonhaze events bring out the exact companies, company owners and managers, that our clients (our sponsors that we sell to) want to speak with. In other words, our Lemonhaze events get the owners, c-suite, managers, buyers, and salespeople of all the cannabis companies in the pacific northwest to attend. \n\n2. Lemonhaze events are very business oriented, but with a party and non-corporate feel. They are very similar to South by Southwest, in the fact that the “fun and interesting and entertaining” aspects of our events make attendees want to be there and to want to visit all the booths of our clients (our sponsors that we sell to). \n\n3. Lemonhaze events provide the highest ROI (return on investment) for our clients and sponsors. By being a sponsor at a Lemonhaze event, our sponsors sales will grow, and they will have a better relationship with other cannabis companies. This is due to the “fun and exciting” networking opportunities we provide with booths, cocktail parties, business seminars, education about products and the industry.
