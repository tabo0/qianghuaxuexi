Users are able to respond to the question, view and rate the anonymous submissions of others, and see the top ranked submissions as determined by the group.  \r\n\r\nThe tool takes its name from the waggle dance of the honeybee, a decision making phenomena that all organizations can learn from.  Honeybees perform a Waggle Dance to convey information about important decisions like where to move the hive or where to find food. Before making these important decision, the colony then uses swarm intelligence to confirm the best solution.  Because of this democratic and efficient approach, honeybees have been able to survive millions of years because they are able to effectively source information and gain consensus to help make good decisions.","legacy_brief_sections":[{"label":"Tell us what you need","questions":[{"label":"What is the exact name you would like in your logo?","legacy_domid":"id_logo_exact_name","value":"Waggl","name":"logo_exact_name","legacy_field_id":756216},{"label":"What is your industry?","legacy_domid":"id_your_industry","value":"Software and InfoTech","name":"your_industry","legacy_field_id":756217},{"label":"What are the top 3 things you would like to communicate through your logo?","legacy_domid":"id_logo_top_communicate","value":"Waggl is not boring (like a survey) but instead creates an engaging and fluid experience where everyone benefits (both the person asking the question and those answering).\n\n- We believe the best insights already exist in your crowd, people just need an easier way to discover them.\n- We believe that people make better decisions when they tap into the wisdom of their crowd. \n- We believe there is an opportunity to transform how organizations communicate so the best the best intelligence can rise to the top.","name":"logo_top_communicate","legacy_field_id":756218},{"label":"What logo styles do you like (image + text, image only, text only, etc.)","legacy_domid":"id_what_logo_styles","value":"Image plus text.  \n\nWe would like to be able to use the image+text logo and also use the image only as needed (for example as the icon on an app button for a mobile device) .","name":"what_logo_styles","legacy_field_id":756219},{"label":"Do you have any other info or links you want to share?","legacy_domid":"id_logo_info_share","value":"http://info.weachieve.co - this is the beta version of the product aimed towards the Training and Development organization.
