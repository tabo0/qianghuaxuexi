The key is memory!\r\nI am an expert in memory and my last name is FARROW. Extra points if you google my name Dave Farrow, that will give you my background. \r\nSo my last logo looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh, Sounds cheesy but it doubled my sales because it was a good mnemonic and as a memory expert turned marketing expert a lot of people want to know how to be more memorable. \r\nGoing forward I want to keep the memorable aspect of my logo but use a different gimmick that is less tacky.   ARROW!\r\nT his new logo needs to look like an arrow. Because of my brand it is really important that people get an \"ah ha\" moment when they see the logo that they realize it looks like an arrow and that is to help them remember the name. \r\nSo I am not looking for a subtle arrow like in the fed ex logo but something very clear yet at the same time very modern and tasteful.\r\n \r\nI am looking for both typography solutions and a symbol of an arrow to achieve this result and i am open to creativity.\r\nImportant: I have a few companies that this logo will need to cover. Same logo theme but splitting off\r\n 1. Farrow Memory  2. Farrow Communications 3. FarrowBOT \r\nI have raised the prize money to compensate for the fact that there is a bigger scope to this logo.\r\n\r\nI have attached a copy of my business card to show the old logo.\r\nPlease make a logo for Farrow Communications , Farrow Memory, and FarrowBOT respectively. The arrow should be a part of the word Farrow and be interacting with the word in some way like going through it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat logo styles do you like (image + text, image only, text only, etc.)\r\nWe want tasteful and modern in style. This company must be able to be placed on a bill board along side other silicon valley tech startups and look modern and professional. \r\nAs a side note the arrow makes me think of moving forward or thinking of the future if that helps. The previous design is something we were happy with it was just the content that was tacky. \r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have any other info or links you want to share?\r\nattached is a few .jpg examples of my OLD logo as well as an animation of several ways that we used that OLD logo. \r\n\r\nHere is my TEDx talk where I teach some memory techniques and talk about my businesses. \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M5rFiVLeR0&t=9s","description":null,"legacy_brief_sections":[{"questions":[{"legacy_domid":"id_logo_exact_name","value":"FARROW COMMUNICATIONS","label":"What is the exact name you would like in your logo?","legacy_field_id":1268606,"name":"logo_exact_name"},{"legacy_domid":"id_your_industry","value":"Advertising and Marketing","label":"What is your industry?","legacy_field_id":1268607,"name":"your_industry"},{"legacy_domid":"id_logo_top_communicate","value":"<p>New LOGO!! OK I just had one campaign for a new logo and it did not quite hit the mark so we went back to the drawing board and came up with a more specific ask.</p><p>Look at the description below for the logo. We want a logo with the word FARROW and an ARROW to be incorporated into it. But to be clear we want a modern style that has a cool edgy look to it. So we are looking for creative fonts and to have the arrow go from the left all the way to the right. We want your input to find the right mark so please ask us questions. We had a little trouble logging in for a few day so we were not able to comment on the entries for a while but we are here now and will be able to participate from here on out.</p><p>I have attached some pictures of a mock up of what we are looking for. THESE MOCK UPS ARE THE BASIC IDEA OF WHAT WE WANT BUT THEY LOOK DATED AND WE WANT IT TO LOOK MORE MODERN.</p><p>The arrow in the images is a half an arrow going across the top of the word. We realized that we want an arrow that goes across the whole word like this or under it. The problem is these logos look like they are from the 90s and they also look a little too much like an airline. We want an arrow feel but modern like something from a modern looking company today.</p><p>The idea of the logo in the picture is that the arrow is cut in half, but is still an arrow. The logo has to give the memory ah hah moment but not look tacky or dated or old. This is to be modern and contemporary.</p><p>Also we want the arrow to go from the left to the right and not be too pointy. That said be creative. This is our passion and we want it to work well. Please improve on this design but follow the instructions we just gave.</p>","label":"What are the top 3 things you would like to communicate through your logo?","legacy_field_id":1268608,"name":"logo_top_communicate"},{"legacy_domid":"id_what_logo_styles","value":"We want tasteful and modern in style.
