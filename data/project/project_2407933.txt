This is a friendly, supportive and approachable community \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat logo styles do you like (image + text, image only, text only, etc.)\r\nWe are primarily interested in an Image/text logo. The most obvious image would be something related to the double helix of DNA. We are not opposed to that, and in many ways it makes sense -  as long as it is not clich or overly complex. Since the site is about genetic genealogy, the second imagery a designer may jump toward would be a tree or leaves. If you want to explore that approach, that is fine, but wed encourage you to explore other options instead. The tree/leaf approach has been over-done and also relates primarily to the more traditional approach to genealogy. \r\n\r\nOne other possibility would be incorporating some elements of a chromosome browser which is a tool genetic genealogists use to view which portions of dna from one person match those of another person. Ive attached some samples of what a chromosome browser may look like. Do not use those exact images, but an approach that has the feel of that look could be interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have any other info or links you want to share?\r\nDNA Central will be a place for the genetic genealogy community to gather for education, interaction and to have fun while learning about using DNA for genealogy. Users will subscribe to receive access to videos, blog posts, community boards and the latest news and information to help them to learn to get the most information possible from their DNA results. \r\n\r\nDNA Central users will experience a site and community that is fun and engaging, filled with interesting and friendly people with common goals and challenges. The site will feature some of the most knowledgeable administrators in the industry, with an environment that is personal, nurturing and encouraging. \r\n\r\nGenetic genealogy is a fairly new approach to helping genealogists to track down ancestors who had previously eluded discovery. By using DNA testing genealogist can use some sophisticated tools to discover others who share common ancestors. The process can be very complicated and overwhelming for many.  But, even the most novice genealogists can learn the steps and tools necessary to be very successful  if they can learn in a supportive and thoughtful environment. DNA Central will be a place where users from novice to expert can learn, contribute and participate in learning and even pushing the boundaries of the current tools.\r\n\r\nLast, DNA Central helps users approach what can be some very complicated science and understand how to use it in an easy way. To help communicate this simplicity and approachable feel, the logo should not be overly complicated. It should communicate quickly and easily exactly what the site stands for  in a very friendly and approachable way.","description":"Help us create a logo for an exciting new online community.
