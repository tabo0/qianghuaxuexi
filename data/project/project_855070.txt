Graphs will sit front and center on website.  See entry 33 of \"Website & Logo Design - Helping to explain the curent economic crisis, $1,200\" on www.crowdspring.com.\r\n\r\nMaps fill placeholder on front page and will need to integrate with entry 33's color scheme and feel.\r\n\r\nHERE IS WHAT WE NEED:\r\n\r\nFOUR TABS: \r\nTab 1: map of USA (with 3 versions based on specific data)\r\nTab 2: map of Europe (with 3 versions based on specific data)\r\nTab 3: map of the world  (with 2 versions based on specific data\r\nTab 4: two columns, each with 3 graphs simple line or bar graphs.\r\n\r\nTAB 1: 3D map of USA\r\n3 map of the USA.  Once map format is finalized, we'll need a couple of versions of the format to demonstrate how the map would change as data changes.  See examples we like below for specific details how the 3D structure will look.   The following is great example of the different heights for each (province).  The example is from Canada but we'd want it applied to the USA http://www.geocities.com/stevejford/Premiere_H2O.jpg\r\n\r\nGraph background to include mechanism for visitors to change the year (e.g. see sliding bar on the following http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2009/map.economy/index.html)\r\n\r\nGraph to include mechanism to highlight particular states and display pop up or blow out with specific data for that state.  For example:  \r\n\"NEW JERSEY\r\nUnemployment 8.6% \r\nState Deficit December 31st $20 billion, \r\nFall in House Prices since June 2006 -15%\"\r\n\r\nTAB 2: 3D map of Europe\r\nSame as Tab 1 but with map of Europe.  Must include all members of EU.\r\n\r\nTAB 3: 2D map of world\r\nNeed to communicate the following:\r\na) level of debt vs savings of different countries (e.g. US & UK heaving indebted, China and Saudi Arabia with significant foreign reserves)\r\nb) Unemployment levels in selected countries\r\n\r\nTAB 4: 4 pairs of graphs arranged vertically in two columns\r\nPair A) GDP 1929 - 1939 and 2007 - 2017\r\nPair B) Unemployment 1929 - 1939 and 2007 - 2017\r\nPair C) Stock market (in 2009 dollars) 1929 - 1939 and 2007 - 2017\r\nPair D) Total debt (as a percentage of GDP) 1929 - 1939 and 2007 - 2017\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR TARGET AUDIENCE IS:\r\n\r\nGeneral public with moderate to low financial literacy wanting to understand the economic crisis and how it will impact their financial futures.  Focus on baby boomers seeking a historical perspective.  \r\n\r\nDesigned to provide an interactive mechanism for visitors to immediately engage with the site so they bookmark it and they recommend the site to their friends\r\n\r\nWE LIKE THESE DESIGNS:\r\n\r\nThe surface of each \"state\" will vary depending on the data inputs.  For example, the surface of the states in the attached map are at different levels.  \r\nhttp://files.turbosquid.com/Preview/Content_on_1_5_2006_19_49_10/usa2.jpg06c21e3f-6d54-458b-b87d-ab9432323baaLarge.jpg\r\n\r\nTo keep the design elegant, in our map, all of the states in the map should be the same color as is in the following\r\n\r\nhttp://www.istockphoto.com/file_thumbview_approve/5954245/2/istockphoto_5954245-usa-3d-map.jpg\r\n\r\nExcept, when a site visitor clicks on their particular state in which the state should change to a different color as in the following http://www.softsia.com/screenshots/usamaplocator_v3gy.jpg\r\n\r\nThe bird eye angle on this map looks about right (though the height of each state will need to be greater so we can show differentiation between states) http://www.geobrush.com/samples/USA2.gif\r\n\r\nThe following is great example of the different heights for each (province).  The example is from Canada but we'd want it applied to the USA http://www.geocities.com/stevejford/Premiere_H2O.jpg\r\n\r\nWE ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE (or we don't want to see) THIS IN OUR DESIGN:\r\n\r\nElegant and intuitive design.  People must be able to immediately understand the graph (i.e. within seconds).  Legends should be well identified and easy to understand.  The data driving the \"graph map\" will be communicating a sufficiently complex image so colors should be kept to 1 or 2 colors. \r\n\r\nWe're open to dark or light background - just don't want it too \"busy\".","description":null,"legacy_brief_sections":[]},"brief_questions":[{"description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
