The audience for that?  We suspect it's ultimately broad but likely always thoughtful and relatively well-educated.  We are aiming at college-educated adults and up -- think entrepreneurs, policy-makers, educators, investors, parents...anyone with a strong stake in trying to understand where we're headed.\n\n\nWhat are the top 3 things you would like to communicate through your logo?\nEconomaney.com is the launching point for a content-based media company with its founder and Chief Executive, successful serial entrepreneur Dave Maney, as its ringmaster, editor, curator, and dot-connector-in-chief. The site is designed to be stylish in appearance (it is anchored in a Wordpress CMS with a theme <dummy info> that you can look at to get a visual style and sense:  http://www.elegantthemes.com/preview/TheStyle/ ).  The site's background color will be a sort of Barn Red.  The site is designed as a few-times-a-week type of destination for a reader, and as noted will be a launching point for other content-based media efforts over time.\n\nManey's career began in the newspaper industry, moved on to cable television and telecommunications, and then into finance and innovative adult education.  He has founded two companies, one of which was acquired by a large telecommunications equipment company and one of which continues today under the direction of Maney's co-founder.  Maney is known in his circles as an excellent communicator who's passionate, well-connected, intelligent, people-smart, and quick-witted.\n\nSo three things to communicate:\n1. Connecting the dots of the economic future.\n2. User-friendly, understandable content anchored in the thinking of a real person.\n3. Innovative, savvy and stylish but not cold -- capable of seeing the humor in the human condition.\n\n\nWhat logo styles do you like (text only, image only, text and image, etc.)?\nNeed a logo that combines both the image and the \"Economaney.com\" text.  It will initially be featured prominently on the website, but is also destined for early use in social media, mobile applications, on merchandise, and in backgrounds for other media work.  We like the idea of a human figure in the logo, possibly vaguely suggestive of Maney, but we are by no means limited to that.  HERE'S THE MOST IMPORTANT NOTE TO CREATIVES: WE WANT YOU TO PUSH FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT, FUNDAMENTALLY INTRIGUING, PROBABLY WITH A LIGHT TOUCH.  WE TAKE THE LOGO DEVELOPMENT TASK VERY SERIOUSLY, AND HAVE BEEN VERY PLEASED WITH OUR EFFORTS IN TWO PREVIOUS START-UPS.\n\n\n\n\nWhat colors do you want to see in your logo?\nWide open, other than to say it needs to work against the Barn Red (meaning a slightly darker shade of red, but not so dark as Brick Red) background of the Economaney.com website.\n\n\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your logo?\nSee above.\n\n\nWhere will your logo be used (print, website, etc.)?\nEverywhere, we hope. This initial rollout is for the Economaney.com website, but social media friendliness, mobile friendliness, and conference-style show-biz friendliness is all important. \n\n\nDo you have other info or links you want to share?\nHere is a link to my last company's website.  The site's conceptual work was done for us by Jones Advertising of Chicago, but the text and writing style was Maney's (the site remains largely intact since his departure in 2010):\nwww.headwatersmb.com  .  Headwaters was founded in 2000, and the logo work was done at that time by a Denver-based agency.  \n\nThe logo of Maney's first company, founded in 1994, is attached below.  Worldbridge Broadband Services helped cable television network operators prepare their systems to launch broadband internet services.\n\nSome other random ideas...We're based in Denver, so Western-friendly themes are welcome.  Sucker for vintage late 1940's and early 50's stuff...Particularly love Rockmount Ranchwear...  http://www.rockmount.com/\n\nBeyond that, our sensibilities run to the slightly offbeat and unconventional -- Tom Waits, Weegee the Great, Mexican Loteria art, Dave Alvin, the high Sierra, \"District 9,\" Dwight Schrute, ice hockey, and Whole Foods.
