It’s already afternoon, or even evening. You are tired after a hard, long day. You are looking for the perfect combination between naughty and nice, that sweet spot that you so much deserve and will ease your craving. You want something made with indulgent ingredients (think of chocolate, salted caramel and similar goodies), bursting with taste and textures from wholesome ingredients.  It could be single-portioned, or bite-sized, something small, so you won’t feel guilty after having one, or two…. or even if you have a little bit more. Find the right balance to create this “not your ordinary snack”.\n\n•\tWholesome baked: Something that will make you think of home baking and the wonderful smells coming from a hot oven full of tempting treats. Create a baked snack that all family members will love. Ideal for an afternoon tea or as a snack for a school lunch box. Something homely, that reminds you of home baking, but is not a cake, with a combination of rich ingredients (like chocolate chips) and wholesome ingredients (wholegrain, dried cherries, dates) that speak for themselves and remind you of baking at home.  A feel-good snack that will delight the whole family, full of flavour and deliciousness. \n\n•\t“Better for you” Kids Treats: Every day is full of adventures for our children. Kids need a bit of a treat too as they go through their busy day, perhaps even as a surprise they find in their school lunchbox.  But children are choosy and prefer snacks that are sweet, fun, have attractive shapes and are soft to bite. Say no to boring food, dare to be a bit naughty. You have to convince both mums and kids with a single idea that gives mums peace of mind because it has wholesome goodies (use grains, seeds, fruit, etc.) and their kids will eat and enjoy because these goodies are hidden.  Your idea should be able to replace ordinary muesli bars.  \n\nHere are a few things you should consider about your new wholesome snack:\n\n\n•\tWhile you need to find the right balance of better for you and indulgence, do not forget that this snack will be eaten as a treat. Therefore, it has to be a bit naughty to be a reward. This is not health food or fuel for the day or for the gym! \n•\tUse both “naughty” ingredients such as chocolate chips, cookie dough, marshmallow... and wholesome ingredients (grains, nuts, seeds, fruits, flowers and more…). Stay away from artificial stuff.\n•\tNot savoury. We want some sweetness.\n•\tTasty and indulgent. A good balance of ingredients and flavours yet very appetizing. A piece of fruit coated in cereals may be healthy, but it is not really exciting. Add some naughty bits to it like some chocolate or sweet coconut coating and it suddenly becomes something you may crave.\n•\tVisually attractive and diverse (pick several ingredients)\n•\tEasy to bring along with you wherever you go and does not require cooking or preparation.\n•\tThink beyond the bar shape, unless you have an exceptional idea for this format. There are too many bars out there. Explore the world of food and be bold.\n•\tNot refrigerated.  These snacks will be sold in supermarkets aisles, convenience stores and similar outlets. \n•\tFinally, there are many types of snacks out there to choose from.  We are looking for something new and original!\n","company":"Flying Fish Lab is an open-innovation consultancy. This project is for one of our clients, a global food company.
