Mayflower Community Congregational UCC is a courageous, progressive congregation of the United Church of Christ. We share joy in worship and fellowship, nurture people of all ages as an intergenerational community, seek to grow in mind and spirit, support one another in times of grief, and pursue healing and justice in the world around us.\n\nIn recent years, Mayflower has partnered in building Creekside Commons, 30 units of workforce housing, on property adjacent to the church; founded the Mayflower Early Childhood Center for mixed-income families; forged a powerful community-organizing relationship with ISAIAH as a leader congregation; organized to win marriage equality in Minnesota; emerged as national leaders in climate change work; and became the first UCC congregation to divest endowment funds from fossil fuels.\n\nAs an Open and Affirming congregation, we recognize and affirm all people, including gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender persons, as equal recipients of the love and grace of God.\nAs a Peace with Justice congregation, we study and support non-violence and actively work on issues of justice and peace on the local, national, and international levels.\nAs the original Earthwise congregation we are striving toward our goal of becoming a carbon neutral building by 2030 and are implementing zero-waste policies.\nAs an Immigrant Welcoming congregation, we proclaim to immigrants and the community that Mayflower supports brothers and sisters from other countries, documented or not, and happily welcomes them into our church.\nWe strive to be accessible to all in our building, worship, and programming. We are dedicated to working for racial and economic justice within, among, and beyond our church.","logo_style":["image_text"],"anything_else":"This will be the logo for our stewardship campaign/pledge drive. It is an annual financial committment to the work of the church. The theme is inspired by the song. \"How Can  Keep From Singing\" and also the song \"Singing for our Lives\" by Holly Near.  Here is an article for the church newsletter about our theme: \nAre we ready to keep on singing?  How can we keep from singing?\n\nBy Thom Haines for the Stewardship Ministry Team\n\nConsecration Sunday is November 12.  On that day, Mayflower goes to the altar singing Marty Haugen’s “Let Justice Flow Like a River” and commits its financial resources to the work of justice and compassion we share. From now until that day we each discern the amount each of us will pledge.  For Diane and me, our pledge is partly a matter of pad and calculator, but it is much more a habit of our hearts, becoming more and more clear as we ask God to help us and listen for the answer.\n\nI count it as a privilege to be able to join my money with yours to make the world more what God wants.  I have had occasion to regret what I have done with money.  A certain vehicle comes quickly to mind as a colossal waste.  I have never regretted one penny that has gone to Mayflower.  On the contrary, I am amazed at how we fund so many ministries of justice and compassion.  Through God’s grace, we have created some very direct channels that bring sacred truth to power and change the world.  This is difficult work; it will not be finished in our lifetimes, but every dollar committed and given is a planted seed of justice and compassion.  \n\nHow do we know that our seeds will produce fruit?  Wendell Berry gives us a big clue: \n\nPlanting trees early in spring,\nwe make a place for birds to sing\nin time to come. How do we know?\nThey are singing here now.\nThere is no other guarantee\nthat singing will ever be.\n\nIn these times, the proof that our justice songs will reverberate through the centuries is that we’re singing them right here right now.\n\nRev. Sarah Campbell’s words of commitment in 2005 have grown into words of prophetic witness: “We here at Mayflower will keep singing our lives, I will join you, singing of what is—all of it, not just some of it, but all of it—and singing of what will be .. How can we keep from singing?”\n","logo_text":"How Can We Keep From Singing?"},"brief_questions":[{"answer_label":"Project Summary","name":"description","help":"","label":"Summarize your project.","description":"Please provide a 2-3 sentence summary of your project.
