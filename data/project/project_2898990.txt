You can use watermarked layout versions and leave purchase of stock photos to me.\n\n3. Significant upgrade of the visualization on slide 3 - this looks to homegrown now. The ruin icons serve the purpose of me saying what can go wrong. The animation/ build of the slide is needed to follow my story telling.
