We use experiences and relational ministry to really bring scripture to life in ways that are unique, eye-opening and life-changing. \n\n\nHow many pages of print design do you need?\n6 Bookmarks, front and back \n\n\nList the size requirement(s) for your print design\nEach Bookmark is 2 inches by 8 inches. \n\n\nWhat is your industry?\n non-profit Christian adventure camp \n\n\nDescribe the target audience for your print design\nWe are a camp for Jr. High and High School students. We want to be edgy and relevant to the culture, but definitely in a way that reflects Christ and catches the eye. \n\n\nWhat 3 things would you like to communicate to your audience through your print design?\n-Front should be a catchy design and all 6 bookmarks when placed next to each other will make ONE fluid picture (showing how intricate our stories are and how they tie together)\n-Backs will have a place for students to write down certain events that happened during the day for them to place in their Bible and remember as significant parts of their story.  \n--We do not want super \"Christian-y\" type of designs. Basically we'd rather not have your typical Christian art.\n\n\nWhat print design styles do you like?\nwe are hopeful for original designs and creativity! \n\n\nWhat colors do you want to see in your print design?\nMore earth-tones... open to reds, greens, yellows, browns, \n\n\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your print design?\nNo fluorescents/neons, stay away from blue as the dominating color \n\n\nWhat adjectives should best describe your print design?\nCreative!  Implementing the idea of STORY. \n\n\nHow will you use the print design?\nWe will be handing out bookmarks to campers each day.  Each day reflects that day's theme within the bigger theme.\n\n\nWhat content must be included in the print design?\nOur theme for the summer is STORY.  The front of each bookmark should look as though it's all a part of ONE picture, but cut into 6 different pieces. There will be 6 different bookmarks, one for each day of the week--each having the word \"STORY\" (the same on each bookmark) and will show the difference in days by adding an additional word of the day (what, why, who, how, when, where). All in all, each bookmark will look the same with a different additional word for each day. The parenthesis will give you a better idea of what's behind the question word-- doesn't necessarily need to be included, but if it helps, it can be on there. \nSTORY w/ what (what's your story?)\nSTORY w/ why (why are you telling the story that you're telling)\nSTORY w/ who (who is the center of your story?)\nSTORY w/ how (how will you live a better story?)\nSTORY w/ when (when will you start living it?)\nSTORY w/ where (where do you stand?) \n\nbacks can have different colors for each day.  Similar design (with a place for students to write), but difference comes in the theme for that day. \n\nWe've also attached a logo to be used discretely on each bookmark if possible.","description":null,"legacy_brief_sections":[{"questions":[{"legacy_domid":"id_print_design_name","value":"Camp Eagle","label":"Business Name","legacy_field_id":126648,"name":"Business Name"},{"legacy_domid":"id_what_company_does","value":"We're a non-profit Christian summer camp who exist to inspire Christ-like change through outdoor adventure, authentic relationships and Biblical truths.
