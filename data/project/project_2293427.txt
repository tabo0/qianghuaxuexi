Please conduct your own necessary research into what these demographics may be, but a few pointers, 18-35 years of age and living in the United States.\n\n\nWhat are the top 3 things you would like to communicate through your logo?\nFirst, a little about the application. The application helps users who download it stay informed about upcoming concerts by their favorite bands. It also connects them to Facebook and keeps them posted about what concerts their friends are going to, etc. The main goal of the application is to ensure that the user never misses a concert by their favorite bands again. It will be a paid application.\n\nI want the logo to be fitting of a professionally developed, venture backed application. The challenge is blending the young demographic with a professional logo. I want to communicate that the application is something that is useful, easy to use and technologically advanced. It also is about music and concerts as mentioned above so keep that in mind. It is the first such application of it's kind.\n\nIn general: more masculine than feminine, more subtle than bright, more luxury than necessity, more modern than classic.\n\n\nWhat logo styles do you like (text only, image only, text and image, etc.)?\nI like wordmarks (company name in a stylized type and may include small abstract or pictorial elements). I also think a pictoral mark would work well because of the obvious \"shark\" logo option. However, I DON'T want a cartoon shark or anything like that as it is extremely unprofessional. If you want to make a logo that has a shark in it, think more silhouette or like the Jaguar logo (http://www.coventryfirst.co.uk/data/images/new_jaguar_logo__2_.jpg).\n\nIn general, stay away from a simple web 2.0 logo (like that of Skype). You may, however, incorporate web 2.0 elements (fonts, logos, etc.)\n\nAbove all, I'm a huge fan of typographical logos so If you can creatively make a typographical logo for Stage Shark, you'll be at a advantage.
