I will be adding a logo later. \n\n\n- I'm thinking of including a tag line. One possibility is \"The Place to Look Before You Buy\" \n\n\n- Profile photo of user along with their name. Option of having a \"Profile Settings\" button here and changing that button at bottom of page (see further below) to just \"Invite Friends\". \n\n\n- Search box where user can type in name of specific business. Needs to have a heading above or inside the box that says something like \"Looking for a specific business?\" or \"Find Business\".\n\n\n- \"Categories\" button. Clicking the link will slide out a menu from the left side of the screen which lists all the categories in alphabetical order. \n\n\n- Have the three horizontal line icon on the top left of every page of site so users can pull up the list of categories from wherever they're at within the app. \n\n\n- \"My Favorites\" button \n\n\n- Show at least one featured offer on the page, possibly 2 or 3 offers if space is available. The offer may be for one of my advertisers or a banner supplied by an ad server service. \n\n\n- At the bottom of every page I'd like four clickable icons with the following text by each icon: \n    - Home \n    - Order Now \n    - Rewards \n    - Settings/Invite Friends","title":"Home Page"},{"description":"This is the page which will appear if user searches for all the businesses within a category or if they search for a business by name and get a result which consists of multiple businesses.  This list will include anywhere from 2 to 20 businesses.\nList the following for each business: \n- Business Name & Logo. Clicking on either will take user to that business' home page. \n- Open or closed icon \n- Address & phone #, each of which is clickable \n- List of categories they're in. Clicking on a category will jump user to that category list. \n- Distance from current location \n- Order Now icon. \n- View Coupons icon. \n- View Saver ad. Clicking on this will bring up an image of their Saver ad which they can pinch on to zoom in. \n- Icon for linking to their website. \nIf it looks like the page is going to be too cluttered then we can remove some of the above items. Use your discretion as to what you think should be removed.","title":"Multiple Business Display Page"},{"description":"This is the page a user will get when they type in a business name in the search field or click on a specific business when they are on the page which lists multiple businesses.\nThese are the elements I'd like on the page:\n- Business’ logo - Show their rating. I have to confirm that the online ordering system allows for rating once an order is completed. \n\n- Address with a “map” button. - Show distance from current location and have a \"Directions\" button. Clicking the button will load in a navigation app like google maps. \n\n- Order Now.  This will take the user to their mobile ordering page.  Will only work for my restaurant clients.\n\n- Request an Uber & COTA buttons (COTA is the bus service in Columbus. Clicking the button will take user to their navigation page). \n\n- \"Open\" or \"Closed\" listed with Today’s Hours: 9:00am - 11:00pm Include something to click on to show hours for the week.\n\n- Phone number in form of a button so user can click on it to dial. \n\n- e-mail us icon which will launch e-mail application and open new email addressed to client. \n\n- Link to website. Clicking on it will open browser and load page. \n\n- Coupons & Specials. Clicking on it will take user to a new page which lists them. \n\n- Rewards. Clicking on it will take the user to that business' rewards page. \n\n- View our Saver Ad. Clicking this will bring up their ad with an X to close the ad. Need to be able to zoom in on the ad by pinching. \n\n- Reviews (way to write or read). Clicking on it will take user to their reviews page. \n\n- Add to Favorites button. Maybe just display a heart and have it just outlined if not a favorite and red if it is. \n\n- Share with a Friend. I need some suggestions on how that should function. \n\n- Links to their facebook, Instigram, Twitter accounts.","title":"Listing Page for a Single Business"}],"industry":"publishing-and-media","company":"I have been publishing The Saver, a coupon oriented magazine, in The Ohio State University campus area for the past 32 years.
