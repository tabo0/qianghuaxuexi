Its the story of new people cloned from alien goo and the government agent trying to contain them.  \n\nA gel-like substance is suddenly discovered across the country.  Ted Stevens, a Director in the Department of Homeland Security, is assigned to investigate.  He enlists the help of scientists at a government laboratory to analyze the goo.  They discover the substance was sent to Earth and has unique properties; it can clone animals.  (white lab mice are cloned--transformed--in the lab) Ted soon learns the substance can also clone humans. \n\t\nSue is the first new person cloned from the alien substance.  She transforms without any knowledge or memory.  She may look like an adult, but she has the mind of a child.  She can, however, quickly learn about herself and her surroundings.  \n\nAfter receiving additional reports of copies of other citizens, Ted retrieves and contains the new people.  He isolates Sue, five other adults, and five children on an abandoned military base in California.  He and his staff restrict access to outside information.  The less the aliens know, the Department believes, the less danger theyll be.  \n\nWhile confined in their new community, the cloned residents receive a message.  Sue decides she must deliver it, and one morning they find shes gone.\n\nWhen Teds superiors find out, they become irate and order him to recover it.  He must protect the citizens of the United States.\n\nDuring the recovery of Sue, Ted learns of their message and begins to understand the clones true intentions.  He needs to know more about the clones to assess the threat they might be in the future, so he collects samples for DNA fingerprint testing.  The fate of the new people will be decided by the results from Teds friends at the laboratory.\n\n\nSize Info\nTrim size: 5\" x 8\",\nPage count: 235,\nInterior type: Black and White,\nPage color: White,\nSpine width: 0.529\"\n\n\n\nWho are your readers?\nYoung Adults, both male and female\n\n\nWhat 3 things would you like to communicate to your readers with this design?\nOuter space\nDNA\nclones/copies\n\n\nWhat colors do you want to see in your design?\nred, black (outer space), white; primary colors\n\n\nWhat colors do you NOT want to see in your design?\npink, pastels\n\n\nDescribe the style(s) you like (traditional, modern, etc.)\nanimated, but not silly\n\n\nWhat content must be included in your design?\ndouble helix strand of DNA\nnight sky or space\ntwo mice","description":null,"legacy_brief_sections":[{"questions":[{"legacy_domid":"","value":"Andrew D.
