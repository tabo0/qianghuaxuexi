Founded in the belief that meaningful change requires a socially-responsible vision and innovative thinking, the Sam Mazza Foundation empowers charitable organizations to pursue a wide variety of projects that have a direct and measurable impact on the communities they serve.\r\n\r\nThrough awarding grants, the foundation acts as a facilitator who helps grantees fulfill their goals of powerfully impacting the communities they serve. To more effectively galvanize support for their grantees, projects, and communities they impact, the foundation recognizes a critical need to increase public awareness of their work. Beginning this process with a focus on actively growing the organizations brand, the Sam Mazza Foundation would like to develop a distinct visual identity. Completely aligned with their mission and values, the organizations visual identity will initially be used on their collateral materials and website. The website has not yet been designed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERE IS WHAT WE NEED:\r\n\r\n Logo and stationary system. \r\n\r\n The foundation would like to be perceived as a living member of the immediate and \r\nsurrounding communityas a foundation that is there to serve that community\r\nand be actively known to participate and be visible in the areas they fund.\r\n\r\n The foundations brand should convey reliability, accessibility, strength, optimism,\r\nintegrity and benevolence.\r\n\r\nOUR TARGET AUDIENCE IS:\r\n\r\n Qualified organizations who would like to apply for grants\r\n Organizations who have received grants from the foundation in the past\r\n Communities that have been impacted by the foundations grantee organizations\r\n The general public\r\n\r\nWE LIKE THESE DESIGNS:\r\n\r\nSee the attached zip file for a number of screenshots of logo designs that have components which would be favorable or appropriate. There is a wide variety there, but the vast majority are very strong in terms of their execution.\r\n\r\nThe final solution will need to be superbly rendered and typographically s0und.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWE ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE (or we don't want to see) THIS IN OUR DESIGN:\r\n\r\nThe headquarters for the foundation is a castle nestled in the hills near San Francisco. The headquarters are close to the Pacific Ocean and often times partially shrouded in fog. It would be ideal if the castle was featured in the final solution, but it is not absolutely required.  There are a number of images of the castle attached with the brief, and more can be found here: \r\nThere are some images of the castle here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/4pizon/sets/72157604643293477/ and there are more attached to this project.\r\n\r\nOther relevant iconography relating to the castle could work too, but remember -- the solution isn't about the castle for the sake of the castle, but rather for a foundation that works for greater good of its community.\r\n\r\nWe would like to see a wide variety of looks represented, but in specific, we want to see one solution with the castle partly obscured by fog, or the the trees which partially obscure the view of the castle from below.","description":"This project is for a small foundation that would like to develop a distinct logo and stationary system.
