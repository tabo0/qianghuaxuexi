You haven't explained how the ID theft score will be calculated, but either way it will be a quantitative metric.  Thus, a quantitative representation would work best for it. Color is a qualitative feature, and it can be used to only facilitate meaning, but represent it fully. \r\n\r\nIdea behind my designs is expressing ID Theft Score using units named \"BARS\". Every thief deserves to be \"behind the bars\" for his thefts. The higher the risk of identity theft, the more bars the the ID thieves get. \r\n\r\nBars are a universally understood notification. They are used on cellphones globally to indicate the sygnal strength, the more bars - the stronger the sygnal.\r\n\r\nBars can be represented visually using many different styles. I suggest measuring the theft score of the scale from 1 to 5 bars. COlor can be used as faciliatating feature to indiate the score, though it is optional. FOr most users color is percieved with peripheral vision and doesn't require special attention. Exception would be color blind users. This is one of the reasons a color should not be used solely as a metric. But as a facilitating feature it can. I suggest the following scale:\r\n\r\n| - 1 bar - blue - safe/low level of identity theft\r\n|| - 2 bars - green - moderate level\r\n||| - 3 bars - yellow - average\r\n|||| - 4 bars - orange - high\r\n||||| - 5 bars - red - critital\r\n\r\nOn my mockups, I visuallized this concept in three simple ways. Alternative visualizations can be found, either format, social or even humorous, depending which way you want to take it. Depending on what kind of representation is chosen, different approaches can be used, but always user will clearly see his score and undertand if its high or low, as the entire scale will be alwyas visible - bars indicating the score will be shown in intesitive color, for example 3, the rest 2 bars will be displayed shaded, and it will indicate that total there are 5 grades on the scale.  This graphical metric is simple and universal, and it can be styled any way to suit your vision. I'm ready to further develop this idea or many changes or impvorements per you feedback. Look forward to your feedback.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nSergio\r\n\r\nhttp://isergio.co.nr","height":600,"width":800,"id":2507550,"additional_costs":{},"entry":2507550,"revision_number":182,"is_entirely_original":true,"created_at":"2010-04-09T15:09:59+00:00","score":3,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/37/44dc555dd74c42acb041714fe61fd534.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/b1/06303484f7e2403e86fcfb37d291ab5c.jpg"]}],"entry_created_at":"2010-04-09T15:09:59+00:00","offer_value":0.0,"award_value":null,"project":2283779,"entry_feedback":{}}]}
