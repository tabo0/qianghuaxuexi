On the center there is a knob that rotates both ways to adjust direction and speed. The two guides can rotate 90 degress and have a lock system. \nOn the back there is a simple latch to exchange the sanding belts as desired. And on the botton there are two robust pads to secure the product while in use.\nPlease let me know what you think and if you would like and adjustments. \nBest Regards,\nLevorato","id":9943015,"created_at":"2018-01-20T23:04:13.112375+00:00","revision_number":25,"height":5000,"entry":9956046}],"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"award_value":null,"author_username":"Levoras","tip_value":0.0,"eliminated":false,"entry_number":24,"id":9956046,"entry_feedback":{},"winner":false,"updated_at":"2018-01-20T23:04:13.090359+00:00"},{"entry_created_at":"2018-01-19T10:03:30.092099+00:00","author":3064245,"withdrawn":false,"project":2892699,"offer_value":0.0,"entry_type":"image","finalist":false,"revisions":[{"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/3c/2027dc6d55c646c4a94da95cb1ca15c6.jpg"],"additional_costs":{"images":"","fonts":""},"width":2000,"new":false,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/28/b319cfd101994bdaa9cbc564f1c50606","score":0,"is_entirely_original":true,"description":"Hello there.
