In doing this, you would know exactly where you are positioned. This scoring method is best suited to those whom accuracy, precision and detail is key.\r\nThe diagram of the hang-man shows the overall score, this may be more suited to those individuals whom can through diagrams understand their position or score better as they prefer visual aid or in other words going back to basics.\r\nFigure A is my perception of the ID Theft Scoreboard.\r\nFigure B is the same, only the background is in white which was specifically requested.\r\nFigure C includes the point scores i.e. 0 points - 10 points. in order to identify in what end of the scale this is, there is a word to represent the points i.e. Excellent.\r\nthe points and the words are circled in different colors which refer to the levels; Green meaning Excellent and Red meaning Bad.\r\nI am flexible in that the point system can be the opposite whereby 71 points - 100 points can be the highest score, meaning Excellent, as well as changing the colors of each level.\r\nNext to the text there is a diagram of the hang-man for every level, which represents how good or bad the score is. At the highest level, there is no stick-man visible, simply the bare stand itself. As you go further down and the worse your score becomes, the more of the hang-man becomes apparent, which I am sure we all that when playing hang-man it is not in ones interest to reveal the complete stick-man. As you go down the points and levels with the aid of the diagram everything becomes self explanatory.\r\nThe final point score would be visible at the top in the same color as that of the level.\r\nIn my design i have used a combination of techniques which include numbers, colors, words and diagrams to allow the client to be aware of their situation as clearly as possible, without the need to assume how his or her mind works best.\r\nRegarding the three \"next steps\" requested:\r\n- Get Your Full ID Theft Risk Report. \r\n- Contact an ID Theft Consultant. \r\n- Sign Up for ID Theft Protection.\r\nI have added arrows next to each of these \"next steps\" which can be used in the same way as links or buttons. When the cursor is placed on the arrows or the text next to it, it becomes highlighted in yellow, therefore the client will know there is further advice or help available.\r\n\r\nNote: Please note that I did not create the fonts used in the design, these fonts were downloaded from the internet and they are free for use.","height":800,"additional_costs":{},"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/1d/f8e873cfb21f4fc7bb2f51a4d112a6e1.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/3a/112fec47aee645edab6a072f530542c3.jpg"]}],"entry_type":"image","award_value":null,"offer_value":0.0,"entry_number":743,"tip_value":0.0,"author":2297996,"id":2520340,"updated_at":"2010-04-16T02:13:51+00:00","withdrawn":false,"winner":false},{"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"project":2283779,"entry_feedback":{},"finalist":false,"eliminated":false,"author_username":"MmmDesigns","entry_created_at":"2010-04-15T22:52:12+00:00","revisions":[{"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/f6/adadae12d70e40999976f38a95837211.jpg","entry":2520332,"width":800,"score":3,"created_at":"2010-04-15T22:52:12+00:00","revision_number":742,"is_entirely_original":true,"new":false,"id":2520332,"description":"...","height":684,"additional_costs":{},"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/ea/408b0797c95a4fb08c1318bfe45a737d.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/b7/305c8d9262834cbc86a0c6ed7cc434b7.jpg"]}],"entry_type":"image","award_value":null,"offer_value":0.0,"entry_number":742,"tip_value":0.0,"author":2285769,"id":2520332,"updated_at":"2010-04-16T02:10:44+00:00","withdrawn":false,"winner":false},{"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"project":2283779,"entry_feedback":{},"finalist":false,"eliminated":false,"author_username":"adamesdesign","entry_created_at":"2010-04-15T22:48:58+00:00","revisions":[{"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/a1/b1463ab7ac4241a0bd997f3c33590959.jpg","entry":2520328,"width":844,"score":3,"created_at":"2010-04-15T22:48:58+00:00","revision_number":741,"is_entirely_original":true,"new":false,"id":2520328,"description":"A

Looking at the user's point of view, user only want to know how dangerous is their ID to be stolen, i.e :\r\n- [ positive POV ] Is my ID Secure enough ? ( followed up with : if not then what to do? or if it is safe enough now what should i do to prevent it from being stolen ? )\r\n- [ negative POV ] How big is the threat to my ID to be stolen ? ( followed up with quite same question )\r\n\r\n==============\r\nAnalyzing the options\r\n==============\r\n\r\n- Percentage is not intuitive enough\r\n\r\nUsually we do percentage to define progress, the bigger percentage we got the better. And usually we need to do something to achieve more percentage, i.e : 50% indicating there's more work to do, 100% means the mission accomplished. So the higher percentage give better feel to user as they're close to accomplishment ( 100% ). However in this case, usually user didn't even need to do something ( consciously ) to get on higher percentage, in fact its their 'ignorance' or things that they didn't do ( precaution steps to secure their ID ) that will give them more percentage. So its contra-intuitive.\r\n\r\n- Number scale/scoring system.\r\n\r\nAfter several Googling on the ID Risk Scoring usually user get some score ( i.e 320 ) to their risk scoring. I think this kind of scoring isn't helping much, since user then need to study what that score actually mean. By itself the score didn't mean anything to user ( unless after they studied & understand what it means ) \r\n\r\n==============\r\nProposed Solutions\r\n==============\r\nSince we need to make it as simple as it could, and make it so the user could understand what it means in a glance. This leads to my conclusion that the simplest the better. \r\n\r\n- Shield Symbol\r\nThe main keyword is Safety, in other terms its 'Defense'. So as general use, 'Shield' symbol is used. We've seen this symbol everywhere, and in a glance we know its about safety. As for the Shield shape itself, we're going for the simplest shield shape , and try not mimic other already existing shield ( i.e Police Badge ( security) )\r\n\r\n- 5 Level \r\nWhat user really want to know regarding their ID Safety is how safe it is, so in the minimalist form we could make it into two scale (safe, not safe). But since it might still makes user wonder on when it safe how safe it is, and when its not safe how severe it is. Then, inspired by :\r\n\t- MSDS ( Material Safety Data Sheet [Chemical] ) : ( 0-4 )\r\n\t- Fire Danger Level : ( 1-5 )\r\n\t- and Avalanche Danger Level : (1-5)\r\n\r\nI propose we use 5 Level to indicate safety or severity of ID Theft Risk :\r\n\t- Low / Safe \r\n\t- Moderate /Average\r\n\t- High Risk/Threat\r\n\t- Very High Risk / Danger\r\n\t- Extreme/ Imminent / Hazard\r\n\r\n- Color Code\r\nThe color code will be used to make things more clear. We're using :\r\n\t- Green : Safe \r\n\t- Lime Green ( Green to Yellow ) : Moderate \r\n\t- Yellow : High ( user need to be careful )\r\n\t- Orange ( Yellow to Red ) :  Very High \r\n\t- Red : Extreme \r\n\r\n==============\r\n\r\nI'm eager to hear your feedback.

The reason for replacing the form dynamically is that once the score is calculated, personal data is no longer important to display.

Still, user can always go back to the data entry form by clicking \"Back to personal data\" button. \r\n\r\nI selected to visualize the risk score by slider with 0-10 scale. 0, 5 and 10 are static and are always displayed on the scale, while one more number, which matches the calculated risk score, appears under the scale in the bubble and is dynamically changed.
