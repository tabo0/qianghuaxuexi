As for the back cover , I'm just not excited about the fonts or the choice of black. I think I have the fix :) The double paragraph author blurb should be a different color.. that would give the back cover some real zip. I also would like those key words highlighted as noted in my last feedback to you. The caps for \"Emblem America\" and \"Michael An'gileo\" are actually ok.

Thank you so much. I love it. But there are some small changes: (1) please delete the fleur de lis symbol from the sapphire (I don't care for this), rather let it stand alone as a lustrous sapphire gem. But can you add just a touch of \"sparkle\" or \"radiance\" to the sapphire. Be subtle, of course, but I really need just the little sparkle! The size of the sapphire I will leave to you, use your best judgment here. Now, about the banner, I'm having a problem with the \"F\" in \"Faith\".. it needs to be more legible, however I love the current type-style, but maybe you can fix this manually.. this \"F\" looks a like a \"K\" to me, which is a problem. Also, \"Christ\" is misspelled.   Now, about the back cover, the fonts don't work for me.. really kind of drab. Pick something really sharp and tasteful! Also, the words \"The Gift\" at the top need to stand out a little over the rest. Please be careful of the word separations, there are problems here.. the spacing needs to be tight and uniform obviously.. and avoid splitting my name as done on the 2nd line, 2nd paragraph. The author's name must always be intact. Also, one change in the text.. change the word \"ESL\" to \"Advanced\" in the author bio blurb. About the spine of the book, you have some negative space up top which can be utilized creatively. I suggest putting the sapphire gem here! Finally, about the book specs for Createspace, be mindful of the dimensions and the page length (144 pages) so that all measurements and proportions are correct, as this can really affect the width of the book spine (I'm sure you know this).

Several correction though. The sub-title should be under the title and needs to be separated and punctuated as described. The sapphire needs to be ablaze with rich, sparking blue. The author name should be in black, and the eagle needs to protect the shield more like a covering angel, that is must be ALL WHITE... the motto under the shield needs to be designed in the style of a medieval coat or arm. A kind of horizontal banner, and there are many examples under \"coat of arms\" on Google. Emblem America is misspelled on the bottom. In general, feels a bit too much like Photoshop, whereas this project calls for illustrations of a highly personal and unique artist style. Thank you again!
