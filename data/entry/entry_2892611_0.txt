Thank you very much for your feedback. I have some explanations about the shape of this model which as you have said is similar to the product of your competitors. As a product designer I have to observe  the needs of the consumers and what do you want (based on brief), also have to consider aesthetics and functions. ---------- Let's discuss the shape of the roof first. I have googled \"portable shelter / shed / storage\" to find out other products, prices, and what consumers want. Most have gable-shaped roofs like my model, some are dome-shaped (but only for very temporary recreation tents). I think this shape is very effective to prevent puddles and make tarps more durable. ---------- the cube-shaped body of the  cover makes it stronger and easier to set up (will save the number of frames, and all can be stored in a 5-ft long box). Size is 6x6x6.8 as a minimal dimension for storing an ATV or a lawn mower (also considering the price is 100 $ that seems reasonable for this size). ---------- All manufacturers want their products unique and different from their competitors, but design It's not just what it looks like and feels like, design is how it works (Steve Jobs). Trust me sir, this will be the best model for your portable shelter","id":9935217,"created_at":"2018-01-10T10:21:33.161447+00:00","revision_number":9,"height":6000,"entry":9947196},{"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/83/64f7a3202db84f28bcfed08929bbec10.jpg"],"additional_costs":{"images":"","fonts":""},"width":1000,"new":false,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/62/ba927898f3664a8cb4dfae51eafe738b","score":0,"is_entirely_original":true,"description":"Helo.
