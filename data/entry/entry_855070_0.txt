here is an idea i want to run by you as you look at the image.\r\n\r\nTitle reflects the Chart Presented along with year, month\r\n\r\nThe (3) links to varying data (Unemployment, etc on left hand side)\r\n\r\nThe slider bar is what i think may be a great solution for this to handle the immense timeline and without having to squeeze elements together or pack to tightly while allowing for growth and expansion :)\r\n\r\nSo you have a breadcrumb (Current Year 'x') along with dunamic data pulled in from database that form a relation with current month to previous (or whatever you want to show) \r\nI think this helps tie in the relativism to the data with a link.\r\n\r\nThe sliderwill always contain each month with a highlight as shown for selected month.\r\nThe neat thing is that as the slider bar hits on of the boxes on the right or left the year will change to the previous or next.\r\nThis allows you to not be restricted in your data.\r\n\r\nThe other neat feature would be as you scroll the slider you have a few things happening:\r\n1- the date and year above the map changes to reflect position\r\n2- Current year changes as needed \r\n3- the ticker bar with specific relationship data updates dynamically\r\n\r\nSo, in concept I want to do a few things:\r\n1- Display relevant data\r\n2- Engage the visitor in a dynamic experience\r\n3- Educate and inspire the user to dig deeper and want to learn more\r\n\r\nI tried to follow the link you sent to CNN but it did not work.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your thoughts and comments\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nvibes35","is_entirely_original":true,"additional_costs":{},"width":800,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/d0/2e41caf8e42c4a67bf565a78d3569235.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/fa/0df1b3e3f25e404c924aac95d55c3770.jpg"]}],"offer_value":0.0,"entry_feedback":{},"tip_value":0.0,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"winner":true},{"author":453063,"eliminated":false,"finalist":false,"withdrawn":false,"award_value":null,"author_username":"vibes35","project":855070,"updated_at":"2009-04-03T14:38:35+00:00","entry_type":"image","id":868509,"entry_created_at":"2009-04-03T14:38:35+00:00","entry_number":9,"revisions":[{"score":4,"created_at":"2009-04-03T14:38:35+00:00","height":800,"entry":868509,"new":false,"id":868509,"revision_number":9,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/ca/01ff56ea8e404a45a59e15e4496338e8.jpg","description":"Hi:)\r\n\r\nShowing
