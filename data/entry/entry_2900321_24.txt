The color of the logo is great and we like the font that is used, however, there are a couple of things that aren't what we're looking for. The cross that was included is not our broken cross that was shown as an example. We aren't really looking to incorporate shapes that are outside our existing cross, so that doesn't meet what we are looking for. We are also looking for something that has a little more shape, where the work \"Kids\" might be 'held' by a shape or something. That could provide a little more of a dynamic look for us.

Basically, it's a cool, rich navy without a lot of purple undertones. For the cross/exclamation point: we would like to see if you could remove the exclamation point part, and then create the look of a whimsical broken cross where the cross is. So basically, taking our existing cross but making it more \"fun\". That way, it wouldn't be as great of a diversion from what is existing, but the kids stuff could look less corporate.
