Change them back to your first entries.\n\nPlease read the following text again more carefully:\n\n2. \nFirst, the word Blossom needs to be stronger in colour - more of a darker pink from the darker flowers. \n\n3. The leaves need more depth as well. Try bring in different shades /tones of green from the soft one you already have got to a more yellowy to turquoisy green. (look at the update again). \n\n4.
