I know that I am too late but my design has universal appeal. Two universally known things have inspired my design. One was the traffic light and other was cards used in soccer game. First thing direct people about action to take, should they stop or wait or go. Second thing convey the message about their state, they are in or out.\r\nTo define functionality of my scoring meter or say score board I have created these bases which determine the stage of risk for someone. (a) How largely information about someone are available. (b) On which places these information are available. (c) Determine the percentage, what percent of places is safe, how much are dangerous, and what percent is ‘may be safe, may be danger”.\r\nI have defined three new stage of risk. The basic idea of creating new stages was not to create panic into people and at the same time we want them to know their responsibility and security measures if needed. (1st) SAFE & BE CAREFUL STAGE. (2nd) STILL SAFE STAGE. (3rd) ACTION STAGE.\r\nFunctionality: I am using three colors green, orange and red again universal appeal. The score board has light indicators and cards as primary component in design. There are 100 light indicators to represent risk in percentage. Green light represent safe and secure place. Orange light represent ‘” possibly danger place. And red light represents dangerous places. One light indicator is equivalent to one percent of measurement. Point: if 65 percent of places are safe then people see 65 green light indicator on score board, if rest 35 percent are either orange or red or mix of them correspond number of light indicator will be visible. Functionality for displaying cards: 1. Green card will be displayed if green lights are from 60 to 100. 2. Red card will be displayed if more than 10 red lights are on. 3. Orange card will be shown in every other cases and combinations.\r\nThere is one more thing in design that is message box. The message box contain message for user. Our entry has one example.\r\nI want to add one more functionality and one more thing in design to reflect that feature of score board. That feature is measurement of tendency. This feature measures what changes in risk stage can take place with time. The graph can show that stage of someone will change within a time period. And there will be two possibilities, case1: if they follow our suggestion and case2: if they don’t pay any attention. After evaluating information about tendency to change, we can add one more information in message board that will be after how much time there state will change from. Or how much time your high risk state will take to become low risk state.\r\nHope you won’t have any problem to understand my design its functionality and concept behind it. The design and functionality can be improved after knowing more details.\r\nRegards.","created_at":"2010-04-16T21:47:00+00:00","additional_costs":{},"is_entirely_original":false,"revision_number":872,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/19/ab0c67cb6efb4616876e5da9e9a3f64f.jpg","width":580,"entry":2522055,"new":false}],"author_username":"sedi","updated_at":"2010-04-17T22:51:59+00:00","offer_value":0.0,"tip_value":0.0,"project":2283779,"author":2297439,"eliminated":false,"entry_type":"image","winner":false,"withdrawn_by_admin":false},{"withdrawn":false,"entry_number":871,"entry_feedback":{},"id":2522052,"entry_created_at":"2010-04-16T21:40:18+00:00","award_value":null,"finalist":false,"revisions":[{"score":3,"id":2522052,"height":681,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/73/496a8ef1c129461599563223bef1f915.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/79/60c7366569d44397adec7e411a31886d.jpg"],"description":"This is a simple mockup of a billboard.","created_at":"2010-04-16T21:40:18+00:00","additional_costs":{},"is_entirely_original":true,"revision_number":871,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/17/d5f25c9ac2964941a3eea3dca2def1b2.jpg","width":1049,"entry":2522052,"new":false}],"author_username":"creo","updated_at":"2010-04-17T22:53:52+00:00","offer_value":0.0,"tip_value":0.0,"project":2283779,"author":1533946,"eliminated":false,"entry_type":"image","winner":false,"withdrawn_by_admin":false},{"withdrawn":false,"entry_number":870,"entry_feedback":{},"id":2522046,"entry_created_at":"2010-04-16T21:38:13+00:00","award_value":null,"finalist":false,"revisions":[{"score":4,"id":2522046,"height":739,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/50/ea33ed7420f04ac4b11aa5da46e3d665.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/c5/19f6daadd3b3446087e03c5f99284d61.jpg"],"description":"Here are the changes.

I can send over the result to you via email.. it's just not looking good to me...I think we should go with the small dots showing ratios rather than exact numbers.\r\nthanks again Noah for everything, you're a very good art director.. \r\noh, I saw the top rated designs at the dish logo contest. interesting choices (mmmaybe a little bit too simple for me)but after all I'm very curious which one dish is gonna choose. I wish I could participate in that contest (I mean actively) but it's okay. I'm looking forward to working together again..\r\ncheers\r\nanna","created_at":"2010-04-16T21:06:06+00:00","additional_costs":{},"is_entirely_original":false,"revision_number":900,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/b8/3ed9d8e161f04a4b9e3e942f4c6dd6a3.png","width":1667,"entry":2522007,"new":false}],"author_username":"annakovecses","updated_at":"2010-04-17T22:59:12+00:00","offer_value":0.0,"tip_value":0.0,"project":2283779,"author":2283396,"eliminated":false,"entry_type":"image","winner":false,"withdrawn_by_admin":false},{"withdrawn":false,"entry_number":861,"entry_feedback":{},"id":2522006,"entry_created_at":"2010-04-16T21:05:51+00:00","award_value":null,"finalist":false,"revisions":[{"score":4,"id":2522006,"height":800,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/4f/7fa9e379e32b4fc09df770cb351afb8f.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/4d/4530ad958f7141c1b5a23b050aa56975.jpg"],"description":"This scale is more graphic.
