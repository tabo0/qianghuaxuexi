A great fairy tail if you haven read of heard of it, it is a story worth reading that handles of a Donkey, a dog, a cat and a rooster. Wikipedia has some nice information about it. But i thought it fits since the animals find eternal happiness at the end. I thought it fits so well to the name 'HappierPets'.

For the font i choose something that relates to children as well as adults. The color of the 'HappierPets.com' comes from the pets it self to bring balance and harmony. I also added a picture of what the logo could look on your cellphone and made a logo option for your website on where the pets sit beside the text part instead of on top like in the App version.
