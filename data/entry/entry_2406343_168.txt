So i was looking through the app design provided in the brief and i found a couple of inconsistencies and disconnects with the user experience. Let me address them here:\r\n\r\n1. Flash Screen: The mock provided has a progress bar that i assume is user input, however when you click on the \"face icon\" it takes you to the flash screen that has another progress bar. Can you elaborate on how that works?\r\n\r\n2. Do you want the menu bar in the \"session in progress screen as well?\" From a user experience point of view, that would not be a good idea as the screen i have designed would work really well as an overlay on top of any other existing screen already being used.\r\n\r\n3. Is the strain name a text input or a dropdown? As in, can a person just type in whatever he wants or does he need to select from a predefined list of strains?\r\n\r\nOtherwise, here is the layout i had in mind. This converts to dark really well. If i get a positive feedback on this design i will design the rest of the screens using the same layout.\r\n\r\nCheers ^_^","score":4,"is_entirely_original":false,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/b7/4ac77bf3f86f42c4a21ac0d031e9f3a5.jpg"],"revision_number":18,"height":640,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/49/edd3a1a4e7f6489c8e2c61b1510d04b6.png"}],"award_value":null,"entry_created_at":"2017-04-13T16:25:33+00:00","updated_at":"2017-04-13T16:37:42+00:00","withdrawn":false,"tip_value":0.0,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"project":2406343,"entry_number":18,"author":2537805,"finalist":false,"winner":false,"eliminated":false,"entry_feedback":{},"author_username":"nrsidharth","entry_type":"image","offer_value":0.0},{"id":8107087,"revisions":[{"id":8107087,"created_at":"2017-04-13T16:14:32+00:00","additional_costs":{},"width":1494,"new":false,"entry":8107087,"description":"Something like this?\r\nShould I add smoking method in first page and in second page option to choose face in how high you are part?","score":4,"is_entirely_original":false,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/56/1270269fdca44a3c93f276097f0ecec8.jpg"],"revision_number":17,"height":1280,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/98/14d743f013264746b47d45392623b960.jpg"}],"award_value":null,"entry_created_at":"2017-04-13T16:14:32+00:00","updated_at":"2017-04-13T16:39:33+00:00","withdrawn":false,"tip_value":0.0,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"project":2406343,"entry_number":17,"author":2301675,"finalist":false,"winner":false,"eliminated":false,"entry_feedback":{},"author_username":"designemaniac","entry_type":"image","offer_value":0.0},{"id":8106924,"revisions":[{"id":8106924,"created_at":"2017-04-13T12:47:05+00:00","additional_costs":{},"width":2308,"new":false,"entry":8106924,"description":"Hi here's my entry for your app. All feedbacks are welcome :) This is what you will get from me if you will choose my designs :\r\n \r\n -Unlimited revisions\r\n -Source Files(PSD)\r\n -Image Files (PNG)\r\n \r\n -Pixel Perfect: Every element made with love and maniacal attention to detail, so your app will look awesome.\r\n \r\n -Vector Shapes: All elements are built with vector shapes, so you can scale them to any size without loosing quality.\r\n \r\n Well Organized: Forget about “Layer copy 999” problem.
