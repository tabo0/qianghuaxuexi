I do have to agree that the new design is kind of plain without the strong contrast. However, I got back to the drawing board and redo most of the components while adding new ones at the same time.\r\n\r\nI tried not to follow blvd design too much. That why I place the LatestNews at the bottom instead.\r\n\r\nDesign is not perfected yet but I would like to hear what you have to say regarding the new layout.

Here is my first proposal.\r\nChosen color scheme is based on the corporate colors. I limited the amount of black used as most people find it \"uninviting\".\r\n\r\nA large billboard style header is used with tabs located underneath. Followed by a row of eyecandyicons models positioned at prominent area. Visitor can scroll through the thumbnails with brief info upon rollover. A long vertical thumbnail shape is chosen instead of regular square. 3/4 body length is best way to showcase face together with her figure.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom, 3 columns allow News, promotion, event, etc to be fixed in.\r\n\r\nHope you will like the design.\r\n\r\nQns: Will there be a member section?","is_entirely_original":false,"additional_costs":{},"width":1280,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/51/7773e1d6545f470983dc935d8458bfae.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/39/2dc57714589b48b8965c513468d72dae.jpg"]}],"offer_value":0.0,"entry_feedback":{},"tip_value":0.0,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"winner":false}]}
