The normal desktop printers (ink-jet and\ncolour photocopier) are designed to work happily with a range of image file formats, including JPEG compressed files. However they\nwill still work best with the maximum amount of image data supplied by an uncompressed image such as a PSD file.\n\nEPS: This is an industry standard, meaning \"Encapsulated PostScript\". It can be imported into all major design programs, and is often\nthe file of choice for printing companies.\n\nPDF: Portable Document Format (PDF) is a file format used to represent documents in a manner independent of application software, hardware, and operating systems.Each PDF file encapsulates a complete description of a fixed-layout flat document, including the text, fonts, graphics, and other information needed to display it. \n\nFont: This is a standart font, a copy will be included with the final deliverables.\n\nAlso i will include PNG transparent background and JPEG highres 4000x4000 pixel 300 dpi for web.\n\nPlease tell me if you need any change in my designs !\nI will fix it as soon as you reply this messege.\n\nBest,\nAvartde","created_at":"2017-09-07T11:49:32.239043+00:00","additional_costs":{"fonts":"","images":""},"is_entirely_original":true,"revision_number":27,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/e6/1cff592828864e9e8d4faf9073362105","width":1200,"entry":9873731,"new":false}],"author_username":"AVARTDE","updated_at":"2017-09-08T07:37:27.365159+00:00","offer_value":0.0,"tip_value":0.0,"project":2890961,"author":2381184,"eliminated":false,"entry_type":"image","winner":false,"withdrawn_by_admin":false},{"withdrawn":true,"entry_number":23,"entry_feedback":{"feedback":"Can I see this with a different font for 'Minnesota'?

This helps to represent eye consulting clearly and will help to set you apart from your competitors in a highly saturated logo market. The logo will also work as a stand alone icon or favicon. This will be of great value for further branding.\nI hope you may like the design and I look forward to any feedback you may have. I will be happy to make any revisions you request.\nIf you have the time please check out my Crowdspring ratings and feedback to see that I offer a timely and professional service to all my Crowdspring clients. You can also see more of my branding work at square69.com.\nCheers, Angela","created_at":"2017-09-07T07:41:46.279679+00:00","additional_costs":{"fonts":"","images":""},"is_entirely_original":true,"revision_number":17,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/16/f85ed7289f064e099030689ce90178ba","width":800,"entry":9873631,"new":false}],"author_username":"square69","updated_at":"2017-09-22T18:55:10.789802+00:00","offer_value":0.0,"tip_value":0.0,"project":2890961,"author":146620,"eliminated":false,"entry_type":"image","winner":false,"withdrawn_by_admin":false},{"withdrawn":true,"entry_number":9,"entry_feedback":{},"id":9873474,"entry_created_at":"2017-09-07T00:53:07.165394+00:00","award_value":null,"finalist":false,"revisions":[{"score":1,"id":9872129,"height":800,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/f4/3973c11027bc48239214be848755b0ad.jpg"],"description":"MEC - Minnesota Eye Consultants - pls. let me know if there is something which needs to be changed...","created_at":"2017-09-07T00:53:07.556853+00:00","additional_costs":{"fonts":"","images":""},"is_entirely_original":true,"revision_number":9,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/af/097fc1fd2159424c86534bbba410c850","width":800,"entry":9873474,"new":false}],"author_username":"annbella","updated_at":"2017-09-08T00:21:40.938740+00:00","offer_value":0.0,"tip_value":0.0,"project":2890961,"author":2524573,"eliminated":false,"entry_type":"image","winner":false,"withdrawn_by_admin":false},{"withdrawn":true,"entry_number":8,"entry_feedback":{},"id":9873472,"entry_created_at":"2017-09-07T00:42:06.350523+00:00","award_value":null,"finalist":false,"revisions":[{"score":0,"id":9872127,"height":800,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/bb/6275eb24b09c4cfcb5d92066d626004a.jpg"],"description":"MEC - pls,  let me know if there is something which needs to be changed...","created_at":"2017-09-07T00:42:06.760854+00:00","additional_costs":{"fonts":"","images":""},"is_entirely_original":true,"revision_number":8,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/f6/096d94ce270f4b2997f9f21d68fc87c5","width":800,"entry":9873472,"new":false}],"author_username":"annbella","updated_at":"2017-09-07T00:45:46.153680+00:00","offer_value":0.0,"tip_value":0.0,"project":2890961,"author":2524573,"eliminated":false,"entry_type":"image","winner":false,"withdrawn_by_admin":false}]}
