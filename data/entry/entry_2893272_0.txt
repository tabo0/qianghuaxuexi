Here the two hemispheres of the brain are constructed from geometric shapes. These shapes have been displaced a little to help represent the confusion and uncertainty associated with Epilepsy. In the second of these two entries I have completed the second hemisphere. This is to help say that the American Epilepsy Institute can help to 'put the pieces back together'.\nI hope you may like this concept and again look forward to any feedback you may have.\nCheers, Angela","id":9953957,"created_at":"2018-02-05T12:21:17.046542+00:00","revision_number":99,"height":924,"entry":9967862}],"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"award_value":null,"author_username":"square69","tip_value":0.0,"eliminated":true,"entry_number":95,"id":9967862,"entry_feedback":{},"winner":false,"updated_at":"2018-02-08T17:51:54.176410+00:00"},{"entry_created_at":"2018-02-05T10:13:30.588698+00:00","author":146620,"withdrawn":false,"project":2893272,"offer_value":0.0,"entry_type":"image","finalist":false,"revisions":[{"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/bb/24978cbcb1c5417cac766862c866874c.jpg"],"additional_costs":{"images":"","fonts":""},"width":923,"new":false,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/90/482d1ecbda0b4b188f26d94ebba66aab","score":0,"is_entirely_original":true,"description":"Hello, \nHere is my first entry for your consideration.\nI have kept the design clean and simple. The logo is in the shape of a hexagon to help represent strength and reliability. The stars help to represent both America and neurons whilst the whole design is an abstract representation of the two hemispheres of the brain without being too obvious. \nThe logo will work well across all mediums, at both large and small sizes and in one or more color. The logo will also work as a stand alone icon or as a favicon/avatar. \nI hope you may like the design and I look forward to any feedback you may have. I will be happy to make any revisions you request.\nIf you have the time please check out my Crowdspring ratings and feedback to see that I offer a timely and professional service to all my Crowdspring clients. You can also see more of my branding work at square69.com.\nCheers, Angela","id":9953882,"created_at":"2018-02-05T10:13:30.609386+00:00","revision_number":98,"height":923,"entry":9967792}],"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"award_value":null,"author_username":"square69","tip_value":0.0,"eliminated":true,"entry_number":94,"id":9967792,"entry_feedback":{},"winner":false,"updated_at":"2018-02-08T17:51:13.308149+00:00"},{"entry_created_at":"2018-02-05T03:28:13.438601+00:00","author":2406576,"withdrawn":false,"project":2893272,"offer_value":0.0,"entry_type":"image","finalist":false,"revisions":[{"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/6d/c2497083a6b340e3b97a43769ab324f6.jpg"],"additional_costs":{"images":"","fonts":""},"width":960,"new":false,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/e6/873569d46cb84677a63828824a408589","score":0,"is_entirely_original":true,"description":",","id":9953612,"created_at":"2018-02-05T03:28:13.463721+00:00","revision_number":95,"height":960,"entry":9967539}],"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"award_value":null,"author_username":"Kst29","tip_value":0.0,"eliminated":true,"entry_number":91,"id":9967539,"entry_feedback":{},"winner":false,"updated_at":"2018-02-08T17:54:37.836757+00:00"},{"entry_created_at":"2018-02-04T20:24:44.190643+00:00","author":2507667,"withdrawn":false,"project":2893272,"offer_value":0.0,"entry_type":"image","finalist":false,"revisions":[{"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/5c/f546bd8e9f0542fcb22fd8b08859186d.jpg"],"additional_costs":{"images":"","fonts":""},"width":1100,"new":false,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/4c/d9d35475e6b34c53ae149abf55500533","score":0,"is_entirely_original":true,"description":"The icon represents communication between neurons, in different areas of the brain.
