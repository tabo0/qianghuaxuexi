Good evening. I am very happy to be able to take part in this very interesting contest. I made for you harness and bed (if you choose me as winner, I would make all what you need. With notes, the final result would be an image in a pdf or .obj files, because I made it in non-CAD software or 3d software which is not for engineering purposes).\n\nThis concept is very simple, you can request additional shapes according to your taste later. I am sorry, this contest will end in 24 hours but there are still very few contestants who submit (this may be due to a very long delay in payment for designers by Crowdspring, recently -- It make us so frustrated). I made this with consideration about the risk if you ask for refund (and we designers get nothing), but I still do it in detail and neat, because I love this job. I will give my best, I promise. Hope you get the best design! ♥♥\n\nMoonRock Studio","height":8003,"width":2000,"id":10085533,"additional_costs":{"fonts":"","images":""},"entry":10116402,"revision_number":3,"is_entirely_original":true,"created_at":"2018-09-06T20:19:02.988656+00:00","score":0,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/19/987192e52a84427a8fec95d34d0719db.jpg"]}],"entry_created_at":"2018-09-06T20:19:02.970910+00:00","offer_value":0.0,"award_value":null,"project":2902515,"entry_feedback":{}},{"author_username":"Gerardo_garcia","entry_number":1,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"entry_type":"image","updated_at":"2018-10-01T21:33:45.467089+00:00","winner":false,"eliminated":false,"finalist":false,"id":10115790,"author":2515345,"withdrawn":false,"tip_value":0.0,"revisions":[{"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/65/f6802632af0542f7b00c6617c9afc7b8","new":false,"description":"Its a bed with two pillows and an edge of felt, and buttoms.","height":1592,"width":3840,"id":10084961,"additional_costs":{"fonts":"","images":""},"entry":10115790,"revision_number":2,"is_entirely_original":true,"created_at":"2018-09-05T20:30:37.517137+00:00","score":0,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/d9/ed3c01aed5c44f09a885b13633dd15c3.jpg"]}],"entry_created_at":"2018-09-05T20:30:37.500135+00:00","offer_value":0.0,"award_value":null,"project":2902515,"entry_feedback":{}}]}
