\nHere is my first entry for your consideration.\nI have kept the design clean, simple and modern. The logomark shows an abstract heart with a home in the negative space.\nThe logo will work well across all mediums, at both large and small sizes and in one or more color. The logo will also work as a stand alone icon or as a favicon/avatar. This will be of great value for any future branding.\nI hope you may like the design and I look forward to any feedback you may have. I will be happy to make any revisions you request.\nIf you have the time please check out my Crowdspring ratings and feedback to see that I offer a timely and professional service to all my Crowdspring clients. You can also see more of my branding work at square69.com.\nCheers, Angela","is_entirely_original":true,"additional_costs":{"images":"","fonts":""},"width":998,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/22/793a87bd6bab437f9b83fe5b2e40eba0.jpg"]}],"offer_value":0.0,"entry_feedback":{},"tip_value":0.0,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"winner":false},{"author":2349203,"eliminated":false,"finalist":false,"withdrawn":true,"award_value":null,"author_username":"borloloy","project":2891588,"updated_at":"2017-11-23T05:32:06.270144+00:00","entry_type":"image","id":9912358,"entry_created_at":"2017-11-13T11:09:49.161644+00:00","entry_number":179,"revisions":[{"score":0,"created_at":"2017-11-13T11:10:02.018391+00:00","height":1200,"entry":9912358,"new":false,"id":9905054,"revision_number":180,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/47/48213d6670bc4ee1b2acf6b870984790","description":"Homluv Logo","is_entirely_original":true,"additional_costs":{"images":"","fonts":""},"width":1200,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/d9/41abea9c2e0944c2b43206f8160e7338.jpg"]}],"offer_value":0.0,"entry_feedback":{},"tip_value":0.0,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"winner":false},{"author":2513801,"eliminated":false,"finalist":false,"withdrawn":true,"award_value":null,"author_username":"creativziner","project":2891588,"updated_at":"2017-11-13T09:41:22.837678+00:00","entry_type":"image","id":9912305,"entry_created_at":"2017-11-13T09:39:22.349809+00:00","entry_number":172,"revisions":[{"score":0,"created_at":"2017-11-13T09:39:40.124679+00:00","height":3339,"entry":9912305,"new":false,"id":9905009,"revision_number":173,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/00/e031a6435fc74f149271be2a08d9f0ef","description":"Please review the revision 01 of concept design 01 and feel free for the feedback.
