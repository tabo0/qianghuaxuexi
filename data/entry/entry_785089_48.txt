A lot of it depends on which aspect of a bridge needs to be brought out more...the support or the function. If it's the support then this one most likely won't make much sense.

By function I'm referring to the aspect of the bridge that implies connection and a way to get from here to there, which got me to start thinking about some other things that share some of those characteristics. At first I thought maybe a gateway (which I still might take a look at) and that led to a doorway or more specifically an open doorway.

Based on the feedback you gave on my previous entry, i have crafted a more realistic bridge symbol.\r\n\r\nNow the bridge looks more heavy and complete compared to my previous proposal. The thickness of the bridge shows power and stability.\r\n\r\nI have tried to keep the visual clean and simple. I didn't want to use a too old fashion kind of bridge. I think this particular bridge has a modern yet classic look to it. \r\n\r\nI think the perspective angle of the bridge show longevity as it is extending to the horizon. And it also make the symbol a little more interesting to look at instead of a straight, boring, front angle.\r\n\r\nAs for the colors, i am using blues and grays. And the tones are more on the pastel side which i think has a feel of \"it's been around for ages\". Kind of a well known and respected business.\r\n\r\nHere you have it.\r\n\r\nLet me know what your thoughts are on this one.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\nDenis.","thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/3d/c887ba2b791b4ef784a0faa6ec77fcb8.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/36/e3f4c0662a824d4fa99637b4743c2bd6.jpg"],"new":false,"score":3,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/7c/11c3c33a9c434d718e21f986affbe81d.jpg","width":793,"entry":797724,"additional_costs":{},"height":708,"is_entirely_original":false,"id":797724,"created_at":"2009-03-21T22:49:09+00:00","revision_number":21}],"withdrawn":false},{"award_value":null,"finalist":false,"tip_value":0.0,"entry_created_at":"2009-03-21T21:48:23+00:00","offer_value":0.0,"updated_at":"2009-03-21T21:48:23+00:00","project":785089,"winner":false,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"author":462262,"entry_number":20,"eliminated":false,"author_username":"Desine_Guy","entry_type":"image","entry_feedback":{},"id":797558,"revisions":[{"description":"Hi\r\n\r\nPlease review my design option for your logo\r\n\r\nCheers","thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/26/1beb0e40adc34acd8ae02445d53803ae.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/07/a0cf1993fea44dc4826a022acb539a4a.jpg"],"new":false,"score":2,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/1f/1a1491fb2d79407286dc4aed8a4e51b7.png","width":800,"entry":797558,"additional_costs":{},"height":800,"is_entirely_original":true,"id":797558,"created_at":"2009-03-21T21:48:23+00:00","revision_number":20}],"withdrawn":false},{"award_value":null,"finalist":false,"tip_value":0.0,"entry_created_at":"2009-03-21T18:54:00+00:00","offer_value":0.0,"updated_at":"2009-03-21T18:54:00+00:00","project":785089,"winner":false,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"author":716566,"entry_number":19,"eliminated":false,"author_username":"pope","entry_type":"image","entry_feedback":{},"id":796909,"revisions":[{"description":"Hi...\r\nI've refined the signature to get a strong feeling of bridge imagery with reduce white space beneath the arch... thank you for your direction.\r\n\r\nAlso i redo the composition of the design elements (graphics, name and tag line) as your request.","thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/84/70dbf51a1bab4039a162da733ba6318c.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/4a/ee210b5d174e4c34b6d65aede7de87b0.jpg"],"new":false,"score":3,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/d6/8c66584dd499478380d8f5b7679227d0.jpg","width":800,"entry":796909,"additional_costs":{},"height":801,"is_entirely_original":false,"id":796909,"created_at":"2009-03-21T18:54:00+00:00","revision_number":19}],"withdrawn":false},{"award_value":null,"finalist":false,"tip_value":0.0,"entry_created_at":"2009-03-21T05:11:11+00:00","offer_value":0.0,"updated_at":"2009-03-21T05:11:11+00:00","project":785089,"winner":false,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"author":716566,"entry_number":18,"eliminated":false,"author_username":"pope","entry_type":"image","entry_feedback":{},"id":794878,"revisions":[{"description":"This my first entry.
