Design this dual-function main shaft system to connect an external rotation tool with acceleration gears for both cases. You can easily place a speed regulator if desired. It can not connect drills since those motors overheat and do not reach the proper RPM. The motors for drills are more robust, with a lot of torque and it does not fit in my opinion to the objective because they are different concepts. It is common to see high speed motors with extension for auxiliary saws and rotating tools.\n\nThe example has no texts but try to be very graphic for easy understanding.\n\nThe upper pulley has an inverted spring regulator that will allow to manually regulate the tension of the sanding belt.\n\nthe knife can be sharpened in the same direction on both sides just by changing the direction.\n\nI will be attentive to your doubts to answer you and make the necessary adjustments.\n\nIf you want an explanation in Spanish I can be more specific since I do not have to translate.\n\nGreetings.","score":0,"is_entirely_original":true,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/1f/2e2918e2b05b47d2b461bdd11ee7b15f.jpg"],"revision_number":5,"height":2000,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/94/d6506aa11fa74e45a16d3030cd619875"}],"award_value":null,"entry_created_at":"2018-01-12T02:29:35.948930+00:00","updated_at":"2018-01-12T02:29:35.948939+00:00","withdrawn":false,"tip_value":0.0,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"project":2892699,"entry_number":5,"author":3060215,"finalist":false,"winner":false,"eliminated":false,"entry_feedback":{},"author_username":"sherandu","entry_type":"image","offer_value":0.0},{"id":9948709,"revisions":[{"id":9936230,"created_at":"2018-01-11T16:48:03.059359+00:00","additional_costs":{"images":"","fonts":""},"width":2000,"new":false,"entry":9948709,"description":"This is all black and red (use color of nocry logo).

This is my concept. I made it with a rotary shaft right in the middle of the motor. Because, first this model makes the guide more tilted down, so the knife tends to be more skewed (movement will be more like swiping instead of cutting). Second, the horizontal part of the belt can be used to sharpen the tip of the arrow, or smooth the agate, resin craft, misc. Third, the handle can be removed and exchanged to the other side so it will feel comfortable if used for left-handed people (this is only my idea, perhaps applicable).
