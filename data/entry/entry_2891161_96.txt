This allowed me to represent the Irish flag colours when the Logo is used against a white background but also works against other backgrounds just as the shape of Ireland within a circle.\n\nIt is a clean and effective realisation of the brief set I feel, both professional and impactful.\n\nI used a modern, assured san serif font which I felt complimented the graphic well. If you'd like to see other options please just let me know.\n\nI used a colour scheme of greens orange as requested but if you'd like to see other options just let me know.\n\nThe Logo works well against light or dark backgrounds as well as in single colour format.\n\nThis is just the start of the process of course - with your feedback and input we can hone in on a logo that you truly love :)\n\nThanks for your time and consideration,\n\nCal","id":9881961,"created_at":"2017-09-27T18:24:12.395671+00:00","revision_number":6,"height":800,"entry":9885648}],"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"award_value":null,"author_username":"cdavisdesigns","tip_value":0.0,"eliminated":true,"entry_number":6,"id":9885648,"entry_feedback":{"composition":true},"winner":false,"updated_at":"2017-10-11T15:09:59.557832+00:00"}]}
