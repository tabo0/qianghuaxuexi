I created a graphic which was born by \n creating the torch from the Statue of Liberty as negative space within a round edged house shape, to give a more friendly, approachable edge.\n\nIt is a design that represents the brief well I feel, both modern and impactful. \n\nI used a confident san serif font which I felt complimented the graphic well. If you'd like to see other options please just let me know. \n\nI used a colour scheme of orange and slate blue to give the sense of a contemporary yet professional company. Again, if youd like to see other options just let me know. \n\nThe Logo works well against light or dark backgrounds as well as in single colour format. \n\nThis is just the start of the process of course - with your feedback and input we can hone in on a logo that you truly love :) \n\nThanks for your time and consideration, \n\nCal","is_entirely_original":true,"additional_costs":{"images":"","fonts":""},"width":850,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/43/88d8759d0e8249a98f05450a73954e71.jpg"]}],"offer_value":0.0,"entry_feedback":{"feedback":"I'd like to see what it looks like with Comic Sans font.

The PSD file format is an industry standard and it allows color\nchanges, or even adding or removing parts of the logo (by hiding or activating layers). The normal desktop printers (ink-jet and\ncolour photocopier) are designed to work happily with a range of image file formats, including JPEG compressed files. However they\nwill still work best with the maximum amount of image data supplied by an uncompressed image such as a PSD file.\n\nEPS: This is an industry standard, meaning \"Encapsulated PostScript\". It can be imported into all major design programs, and is often\nthe file of choice for printing companies.\n\nPDF: Portable Document Format (PDF) is a file format used to represent documents in a manner independent of application software, hardware, and operating systems.Each PDF file encapsulates a complete description of a fixed-layout flat document, including the text, fonts, graphics, and other information needed to display it. \n\nFont: This is a standart font, a copy will be included with the final deliverables.\n\nAlso i will include PNG transparent background and JPEG highres
