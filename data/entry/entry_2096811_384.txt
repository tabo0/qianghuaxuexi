I separated the handle of the fish knife into two halves as I wanted it to allude to maybe chopsticks (if you are spreading to the Asian market) or tongs - it has a level of ambiguity about it but I like the fact you have to look at it for a couple of seconds before you get what it is.\r\n\r\nWell there you go, please let me know your thoughts on the name, and the logo so I can best go about making changes to your liking.\r\n\r\nColour version to follow.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nCal\r\n'","score":0,"is_entirely_original":true,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/55/54ba7b550778475c9b18fc8a3d29ec32.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/20/8beb76bd47b64efea129f50ba9e772c6.jpg"],"revision_number":8,"height":800,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/d8/6b725d7cd6d34e329060e4a6b93728b0.png"}],"award_value":null,"entry_created_at":"2009-11-12T15:16:22+00:00","updated_at":"2014-02-24T06:24:40+00:00","withdrawn":true,"tip_value":0.0,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"project":2096811,"entry_number":8,"author":1962613,"finalist":false,"winner":false,"eliminated":false,"entry_feedback":{},"author_username":"cdavisdesigns","entry_type":"image","offer_value":0.0},{"id":2105717,"revisions":[{"id":2105717,"created_at":"2009-11-12T14:12:30+00:00","additional_costs":{},"width":1502,"new":false,"entry":2105717,"description":"Good Morning\r\n\r\nMy name is Brent and I saw your project for your gourmet food & beverage logo and I believe I can assist you in this.\r\n\r\nPlease find attached some initial concepts. When thinking of a name I think its imperative to think big, just like your ambitions for your company. Therefore pigeon holing a name with references to food and drink only lends itself to a minimalistic approach. After reading your brief I thought, well the concept is in the brief, and I focused in on the word 'entice'. Its a big meaning for a little word and it means so much, especially in food and beverage. It conjures up imagery of being mouth watering as well as being easily remembered. \r\n\r\nThe logo and name is also very refined to meet your educated, travelled demographic, rather than being too obvious, less is more.\r\n\r\n I like to eat at high end restaurants its a small indulgence I like to do now and then. Whenever I go to these establishments the design, logo and even name is usually simple and profound. Gordon Ramsay's 'Maze' restaurant in London is a great example. A great place to eat and their selection of wines is second to none.\r\n\r\nSo the concept of enticing people brought to mind the carrot which also ties nicely in with your harmonious and responsible mantra. It also is a visual metaphor for being enticed, and it is a great graphic by itself. \r\nThe typeface reflects a distinguished, minimalistic and cultural approach without being too heavy.\r\n\r\nThe logo is extremely adaptable, it can be in full color, it can be one color, it can be reversed and looks great on a white background. It will also look great on all aspects of your corporate identity and public packaging.\r\n\r\nI hope you like the concept and direction, and if you have any suggestions or feedback they are most welcomed.\r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from you\r\n\r\nBest\r\nBrent\r\n@CMI Studio","score":3,"is_entirely_original":true,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/4d/ab4b15dc1b6b49f4bace3aa363ed93c6.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/1e/cab453111c7e4befbb2dd3c6a7fb4999.jpg"],"revision_number":6,"height":750,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/bb/279f6e96662c4caf856f47943f0ae251.jpg"}],"award_value":null,"entry_created_at":"2009-11-12T14:12:30+00:00","updated_at":"2013-06-10T13:57:06+00:00","withdrawn":true,"tip_value":0.0,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"project":2096811,"entry_number":6,"author":1716702,"finalist":false,"winner":false,"eliminated":false,"entry_feedback":{},"author_username":"Clevedon","entry_type":"image","offer_value":0.0},{"id":2104171,"revisions":[{"id":2104171,"created_at":"2009-11-12T07:45:13+00:00","additional_costs":{},"width":800,"new":false,"entry":2104171,"description":"First the name I chose and why.\r\n\r\nPastiche\r\n\r\nPastiche is a medley of various ingredients. \r\n\r\nYour brand is also a medley of various ingredients.
