In the idea it gently shows that the baggage (two bottles of the whiskey in first) is carried by the lion itself.\r\nThe form of the shoulder strap which is the result of this idea also makes the bag stronger.\r\n\r\nI wanted to keep the design elegant yet simple in construction. The emphasis should be laid on the brand but in a subtle way. This is why I propose embroidering or interchangeably printing the patterns and signs of Chivas. The logotype itself should be made from metal and sewn on the surface of the bag or embroidered/printed as well as other elements.\r\n\r\nI recommend using 450D Rip-Stop polyester as the material for most parts of the bag.\r\nI propose adding three rubber or plastic stripes on the bottom of the bag, connected with the design of the front and back side as lion's claws, as a trim.\r\n\r\nThe bag contains 4 pockets: biggest main pocket under the upper flap with the curtain and additional inside pocket, flat pocket also under the upper flap for carrying laptop or documents and 2 side pockets, each on one side, for cellphone, wallet, etc.\r\n\r\nThe length of the strap is adjustable as in standard bags so the client can carry it on the shoulder or in hand.\r\n\r\nThe CAD files format is available for this project.\r\nI hope that you will like it!","additional_costs":{},"score":0,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/89/20045b0548644d169badad140eaff89d.jpg"],"created_at":"2011-01-30T21:39:03+00:00","new":false,"entry":3279613,"id":3279613,"height":800}],"tip_value":0.0,"award_value":null,"entry_created_at":"2011-01-30T21:39:03+00:00","eliminated":false,"author_username":"pracus","project":2291730,"id":3279613,"entry_feedback":{}},{"offer_value":0.0,"winner":false,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"author":1035683,"updated_at":"2011-01-25T10:32:42+00:00","withdrawn":true,"entry_type":"image","finalist":false,"entry_number":29,"revisions":[{"width":1280,"revision_number":29,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/6d/5648fcedde1b43fc9a6358989773dd1d.jpg","is_entirely_original":true,"description":"satchel details","additional_costs":{},"score":0,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/68/3024f5b9432b4a3986273a25504c4fbf.jpg"],"created_at":"2011-01-25T10:30:56+00:00","new":false,"entry":3262318,"id":3262318,"height":730}],"tip_value":0.0,"award_value":null,"entry_created_at":"2011-01-25T10:30:56+00:00","eliminated":false,"author_username":"tewster1","project":2291730,"id":3262318,"entry_feedback":{}},{"offer_value":0.0,"winner":false,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"author":2309789,"updated_at":"2011-01-24T20:18:59+00:00","withdrawn":true,"entry_type":"image","finalist":false,"entry_number":17,"revisions":[{"width":800,"revision_number":17,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/1d/a4e99107eb7c4a99ae1d7e61d3d4b606.jpg","is_entirely_original":true,"description":"Hi , \nHere's my concept for your luggage bag. I would like to have a double face bag that differs only in the type of closing/openning - the notebook compartment is the zipper one, and the chivas bottles is the click-clack mechanism. Adjustable strap is provided, as well as the options to reduce the side pannels in case the bag is not full - two buttons that flat the bag.\nBEts allmond. I haven't illustrated any pockets as they would be according to yor budget/needs, but it could easily be illustrated in case this is your direction.\nBest \nAllmond","additional_costs":{},"score":2,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/f6/ec33bebd2ac5406d8b29f3409bc0eb63.jpg"],"created_at":"2011-01-23T09:07:00+00:00","new":false,"entry":3256395,"id":3256395,"height":800}],"tip_value":0.0,"award_value":null,"entry_created_at":"2011-01-23T09:07:00+00:00","eliminated":false,"author_username":"allmond","project":2291730,"id":3256395,"entry_feedback":{}}]}
