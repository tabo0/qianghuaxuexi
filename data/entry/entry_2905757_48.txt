The concept is a simple, clean, dynamic and abstract circular circuit logo mark. The design conveys advance technology, reliable development solutions and professional expertise through the use of clean lines, symmetry and font. It works well both in print and web applications and has both tall & wide versions. It can work on dark & light backgrounds with full color, single color and grayscale options. The colors can be changed to your preference. This can be used on a number of materials and mediums since the design is flexible to reproduce. It's easily recognizable and scales pretty well.","height":1500,"additional_costs":{"images":"","fonts":""},"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/97/05e1515c97a34ea398d4b6de41b9c92f.jpg"]}],"entry_type":"image","award_value":null,"offer_value":0.0,"entry_number":5,"tip_value":0.0,"author":2300135,"id":10163074,"updated_at":"2018-12-04T06:43:45.099367+00:00","withdrawn":true,"winner":false}]}
