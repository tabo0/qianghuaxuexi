I'm still processing having an actual emu in my logo...:). Thanks for incorporating the tagline as well. Based on the signage example (with the white emu), I do prefer the emu to be a single color; not sure if I prefer orange or my darker blue. \nWhich fonts did you use? The \"EMU\" font feels a little too wide, if that makes sense. \nSo, can you:\n1) Show me the emu graphic in a solid color (orange; my darker blue)?\n2) Replace the current \"EMU\" font with one closer to what you used for \"Experience\"\n3) I see how you have the emu positioned, but how would it look to the right of the company name?\n\nThank you so much for your efforts!\nKen"},"finalist":false,"eliminated":false,"author_username":"studio1hub","entry_created_at":"2018-09-24T14:04:54.883822+00:00","revisions":[{"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/c5/9c027275d5f744598dedf054a451f001","entry":10126854,"width":960,"score":5,"created_at":"2018-09-24T14:04:54.901271+00:00","revision_number":14,"is_entirely_original":true,"new":false,"id":10094469,"description":"Thank you for your project invitation, A brand new design concept has been submitted for your consideration, please do give your feedback and star rating to submit designs that would help.
