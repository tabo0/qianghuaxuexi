It's hip, slick, clean; all thing thats would attract a luxury-seeking flashpacker. The colour palette is more retro, and remains bright and fun.

The target audience also is the more luxurious-seeking backpacker, and therefore the design should be sleek, clean, hard edged, and rather simple. The design of the logo is memorable because of the subtle \"B\" (Bed) and \"R\" (Rock) that create the main shape of the backpack. The colour palette is still open at this point, but I have chosen a bright orange, white, and dark grey, keeping the overall design light. The repetitive line pattern can be used throughout other various points of stationary, website, and other materials. I used Corbel for the typography because of its clean look, and the ability to be read easily, especially when small. If you have any suggestions, I would be more than happy to oblige, and would greatly appreciate your feedback.
