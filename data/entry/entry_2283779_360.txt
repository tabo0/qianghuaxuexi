I wanted to engage your thoughts before diving too deep.\r\n\r\nI took an Achem's / Occam's razor approach to find the simplest solution to a complex problem.\r\n\r\nWhen thinking about what icon would be universally understood across all cultures to represent a feeling of security or insecurity, I almost immediately thought of weather. A sunny day can make you feel hopeful that everything is going to be fine. While a thunderstorm or tornado can wreak havok and bring with it both personal and financial loss.\r\n\r\nThe scoring works like this:\r\nYou get 1 of 5 forecasts; after all the score is merely of forecast or prediction of what could happen - your vulnerability to identity theft.\r\n\r\nSunny, Partly Cloudy, Cloudy with a Chance of Rain, Thunderstorm Warning, and Tornado Warning. This gives you the overall picture of how your day (or security) will be. We certainly cannot control the weather, but we can prepare for it.\r\n\r\nThe five locks at the bottom (half locks included) represent a percentage from 0-100 of people who are more secure than you.  So if your score reveals 2.5 locks, 50% of Americans, Russians, or people world wide, are more secure than you. This creates a competitive incentive to become more secure. I thought of using lunar cycles here to continue the theme, but I think the locks are a stronger image.\r\n\r\nThe temperature gauge on the right represents how vulnerable you are in terms of losing assets or experiencing theft to some degree. The closer you get to freezing, the closer your day is to being put on hold (frozen assets, credit cards, etc.).\r\n\r\nWhen the user receives their score, they can mouse over different aspects of the icon to reveal a description and click further to learn how to improve their situation.\r\n\r\nI chose the color blue for the button/icon so the user would feel calm and secure no matter what the forecast, but a color particular to your company would also work.\r\n\r\nThe icons are quite simple, which I think is appropriate, but they can be developed further according to your feedback and direction. Again I wanted to present the idea overall before going too far. Your feedback will be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks.","created_at":"2010-04-11T22:10:53+00:00","additional_costs":{},"is_entirely_original":false,"revision_number":316,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/2f/1ec96f33421e418f8e674c023b3be8d6.jpg","width":800,"entry":2511762,"new":false}],"author_username":"3squared","updated_at":"2010-04-12T02:34:44+00:00","offer_value":0.0,"tip_value":0.0,"project":2283779,"author":2110433,"eliminated":false,"entry_type":"image","winner":false,"withdrawn_by_admin":false},{"withdrawn":false,"entry_number":314,"entry_feedback":{},"id":2511756,"entry_created_at":"2010-04-11T22:02:28+00:00","award_value":null,"finalist":false,"revisions":[{"score":3,"id":2511756,"height":800,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/42/1d8e4032dd384faaa0a0c5c0760705bd.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/6d/c8dd08a6acb54f02a6e8f3235ef11db4.jpg"],"description":"Please accept this concept as merely a sketch of ideas to be developed much further. I wanted to engage your thoughts before diving too deep.\r\n\r\nI took an Achem's / Occam's razor approach to find the simplest solution to a complex problem.\r\n\r\nWhen thinking about what icon would be universally understood across all cultures to represent a feeling of security or insecurity, I almost immediately thought of weather. A sunny day can make you feel hopeful that everything is going to be fine. While a thunderstorm or tornado can wreak havok and bring with it both personal and financial loss.\r\n\r\nThe scoring works like this:\r\nYou get 1 of 5 forecasts; after all the score is merely of forecast or prediction of what could happen - your vulnerability to identity theft.\r\n\r\nSunny, Partly Cloudy, Cloudy with a Chance of Rain, Thunderstorm Warning, and Tornado Warning. This gives you the overall picture of how your day (or security) will be. We certainly cannot control the weather, but we can prepare for it.\r\n\r\nThe five locks at the bottom (half locks included) represent a percentage from 0-100 of people who are more secure than you.  So if your score reveals 2.5 locks, 50% of Americans, Russians, or people world wide, are more secure than you. This creates a competitive incentive to become more secure. I thought of using lunar cycles here to continue the theme, but I think the locks are a stronger image.\r\n\r\nThe temperature gauge on the right represents how vulnerable you are in terms of losing assets or experiencing theft to some degree. The closer you get to freezing, the closer your day is to being put on hold (frozen assets, credit cards, etc.).\r\n\r\nWhen the user receives their score, they can mouse over different aspects of the icon to reveal a description and click further to learn how to improve their situation.\r\n\r\nI chose the color blue for the button/icon so the user would feel calm and secure no matter what the forecast, but a color particular to your company would also work.\r\n\r\nThe icons are quite simple, which I think is appropriate, but they can be developed further according to your feedback and direction. Again I wanted to present the idea overall before going too far. Your feedback will be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks.","created_at":"2010-04-11T22:02:28+00:00","additional_costs":{},"is_entirely_original":false,"revision_number":314,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/af/fceaa6aeb2604e3a8ebb31fee0c7b09c.jpg","width":800,"entry":2511756,"new":false}],"author_username":"3squared","updated_at":"2010-04-12T02:34:13+00:00","offer_value":0.0,"tip_value":0.0,"project":2283779,"author":2110433,"eliminated":false,"entry_type":"image","winner":false,"withdrawn_by_admin":false},{"withdrawn":false,"entry_number":313,"entry_feedback":{},"id":2511752,"entry_created_at":"2010-04-11T21:52:41+00:00","award_value":null,"finalist":false,"revisions":[{"score":3,"id":2511752,"height":800,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/8b/715ffe57923d465aa6925ebea6b182d0.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/09/1325143ff9b4437ebcb23190cefcf642.jpg"],"description":"One more, a smiley...nr 8","created_at":"2010-04-11T21:52:41+00:00","additional_costs":{},"is_entirely_original":true,"revision_number":313,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/90/3a2b86d3af2243259bd8f016b3030c7d.jpg","width":800,"entry":2511752,"new":false}],"author_username":"tomrothster","updated_at":"2010-04-12T02:29:19+00:00","offer_value":0.0,"tip_value":0.0,"project":2283779,"author":932748,"eliminated":false,"entry_type":"image","winner":false,"withdrawn_by_admin":false},{"withdrawn":false,"entry_number":308,"entry_feedback":{},"id":2511672,"entry_created_at":"2010-04-11T21:05:17+00:00","award_value":null,"finalist":false,"revisions":[{"score":2,"id":2511672,"height":800,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/d2/05693d3d4b3346f88789820969ee809f.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/73/c25eaf8c7eaa494ba4c7c200da3f576c.jpg"],"description":"How about this? nr 7","created_at":"2010-04-11T21:05:17+00:00","additional_costs":{},"is_entirely_original":true,"revision_number":308,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/5c/6371677b51684780bcbd2971fa34aecf.jpg","width":800,"entry":2511672,"new":false}],"author_username":"tomrothster","updated_at":"2010-04-12T02:26:09+00:00","offer_value":0.0,"tip_value":0.0,"project":2283779,"author":932748,"eliminated":false,"entry_type":"image","winner":false,"withdrawn_by_admin":false},{"withdrawn":false,"entry_number":305,"entry_feedback":{},"id":2511659,"entry_created_at":"2010-04-11T20:58:44+00:00","award_value":null,"finalist":false,"revisions":[{"score":3,"id":2511659,"height":800,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/8d/22dba9d0a588410dbfd843558b74fb00.jpg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/b9/4d74f8068acd4606babafbab45a68648.jpg"],"description":"If this meter is going to be my desktop IDTheft monitor tracing my online activities, it would be good to blend with my desktop wallpaper.
