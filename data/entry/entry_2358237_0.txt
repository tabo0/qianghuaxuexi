my name is Rudolf.As soon as I got your invitation and had a look in to your project I started to make a modern and good looking app for your busyness.\r\nSo let me describe it, in the top you can see the location, in the right side is the navigation buttons and a search box to make it simple for searching a specific file.\r\nDown the top bar is the main folder where is your location, where you can see the files as well.Under the current folder you can see the other folders and their items on them.If you hover the mouse over a folder you can see the popup where you are able to drag and drop a file in the current folder, or you can click to open it.I also added a empty folder so you can see clearly that it is empty.There are 2 windows as you requested, not sure if you need a top banner but if you do please let me know.As soon as I get your feedback I will start the second page, Please let me know where do I stand in your contest as I don't like shooting in the dark.\r\nThank you.\r\nRudolfi","additional_costs":{},"score":3,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/ab/71eb48687ec74675ad47469b25e1afd1.jpg"],"created_at":"2013-09-02T21:48:27+00:00","new":false,"entry":6157472,"id":6157472,"height":1004}],"tip_value":0.0,"award_value":null,"entry_created_at":"2013-09-02T21:48:27+00:00","eliminated":false,"author_username":"Rudolfi","project":2358237,"id":6157472,"entry_feedback":{}},{"offer_value":0.0,"winner":false,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"author":2388681,"updated_at":"2013-09-02T19:26:24+00:00","withdrawn":false,"entry_type":"image","finalist":false,"entry_number":16,"revisions":[{"width":1536,"revision_number":16,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/71/4054583f7b76454aba563f77630c7164.jpg","is_entirely_original":true,"description":"Something

It's me, Valery.\r\nAfter studying your brief I came up with this concept for the navigation bar.Highly intuitive and functional as well.Plus a sample of the animation (I happen to be a motion designer too :) \r\nThe idea is to have the bar separate itself into little rectangles that represent folders so the user can go wherever he wants in the file system.Once the cursor is hovered over the rectangle which represent a folder its full path is written on a white background plate.You can see this illustrated on the first \"window\" and on the second one which has more folders opened.\r\nHere's a little animation for this project  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8yV5LFUHSs&feature=youtu.be\r\nAttention to the top navigation bar.\r\nThe animation is subtle and quick. just to fit the case.\r\n\r\nBTW I was struggling with the representation of the file names and so on and decided that it would be really cool to have ONE place for that information and that is..the lower left corner.The advantages of this method : \r\n-the text will be legible no matter how small the highlighted circle is (the dark blue on on my concept drawing)\r\n-the user will always know where to look for the file's name in opposite to the version when the text appears next to the circle\r\n-i saw that many entries are incorporating the text inside the circle which shows that they dont understand that when the file is really small no text will be visible, that's why I don't think this is a good idea.\r\nAnd the logic is this - the top bar represents all thats related to the navigation and the lower part of the \"window\" represents operations and information with the files.(notice how the text is colored in both top bar and lower info bar, they correspond to their meaning : brown - file system, blue - file properties )\r\n\r\nOverall I think its quite intuitive.Although need to figure out how to show that the user needs to click in the gray area to enter a folder..\r\n\r\nThanks for the attention!\r\n\r\nValery","additional_costs":{},"score":4,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/56/49da70c4f3b94cd1b0d2b85a680d0d83.jpg"],"created_at":"2013-09-01T22:58:53+00:00","new":false,"entry":6155438,"id":6155438,"height":1065}],"tip_value":0.0,"award_value":null,"entry_created_at":"2013-09-01T22:58:53+00:00","eliminated":false,"author_username":"DarkFox2236","project":2358237,"id":6155438,"entry_feedback":{}},{"offer_value":0.0,"winner":false,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"author":2431947,"updated_at":"2013-09-01T14:44:36+00:00","withdrawn":false,"entry_type":"image","finalist":false,"entry_number":9,"revisions":[{"width":4999,"revision_number":9,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/47/0c5c0ece7a724b928ea92c2f993c18ba.jpg","is_entirely_original":true,"description":"This is my own creativity.","additional_costs":{},"score":2,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/8f/c84c7b0e292e44c9a91cab3934f3a469.jpg"],"created_at":"2013-09-01T08:34:02+00:00","new":false,"entry":6154257,"id":6154257,"height":2296}],"tip_value":0.0,"award_value":null,"entry_created_at":"2013-09-01T08:34:02+00:00","eliminated":false,"author_username":"Excelsoir","project":2358237,"id":6154257,"entry_feedback":{}},{"offer_value":0.0,"winner":false,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"author":2444020,"updated_at":"2013-09-01T18:16:01+00:00","withdrawn":false,"entry_type":"image","finalist":false,"entry_number":8,"revisions":[{"width":2003,"revision_number":8,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/ec/c6a17f4a56304c1ebaed5ea101601362.jpg","is_entirely_original":true,"description":"Circle size & Number show the size & name of files drag into the Blue Area.","additional_costs":{},"score":2,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/0c/5677409e6c1047e89591f8d86011e19c.jpg"],"created_at":"2013-09-01T07:01:23+00:00","new":false,"entry":6154152,"id":6154152,"height":1499}],"tip_value":0.0,"award_value":null,"entry_created_at":"2013-09-01T07:01:23+00:00","eliminated":false,"author_username":"FarhanAlee1234","project":2358237,"id":6154152,"entry_feedback":{}},{"offer_value":0.0,"winner":false,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"author":2444160,"updated_at":"2013-08-31T13:39:31+00:00","withdrawn":false,"entry_type":"image","finalist":false,"entry_number":4,"revisions":[{"width":793,"revision_number":4,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/9e/98417ddd2d8e4c4db3a8a9b47915155e.png","is_entirely_original":true,"description":"Balls and circles for mobile dispositive app. Folder/directory are the big rectangle and the files are linked with the red/orange circles.","additional_costs":{},"score":2,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/a8/85d47a3423c2486fa3f89aaa8699d0fa.jpg"],"created_at":"2013-08-29T23:19:09+00:00","new":false,"entry":6149612,"id":6149612,"height":1241}],"tip_value":0.0,"award_value":null,"entry_created_at":"2013-08-29T23:19:09+00:00","eliminated":false,"author_username":"danielfernandezvega","project":2358237,"id":6149612,"entry_feedback":{}}]}
