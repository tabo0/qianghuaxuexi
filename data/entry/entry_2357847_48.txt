I asked you few days ago is it late for me to participate, so here I am.\r\n\r\nLet me explain my design (I must mention that you comments helped me a lot)-\r\nI wanted to show you one less busy design with simple layout. As you can see, I used only colors that you have on your website because that is important for recognition of your company.\r\n\r\nTo make page less busy, I put information of \"this month\" on page 1, and information about \"whole year\" on the 2. page. On that way, whole space is used and everything simple for understanding. \r\n\r\nFont I used is Arial, the same as on your website, but I can change to any other font you want, just let me know. Also, one important thing... the smallest letter size is 9pt and because of that it is easy to read. A person who doesn't see very well, or some older person, could easily read this text. I don't want to speak bad about other designs...but I think that some of them has text size which is less then 9pt and more 7pt...which is hard to read. Because of that page looks great and doesn't look busy, but on other way you can't read anything.\r\n\r\nAlso, I saw that everyone make some \"circles with percents\" , I am not sure but I think that you need some computer software for making that.\r\n\r\nBe free to tell what you thin about my design. Any change is possible.\r\n\r\nWaiting for your response.\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\nzebrica","score":3,"new":false}],"offer_value":0.0,"eliminated":false},{"author_username":"zoviant","withdrawn":false,"entry_number":216,"finalist":false,"author":2370132,"tip_value":0.0,"entry_type":"image","updated_at":"2013-08-30T16:25:36+00:00","project":2357847,"id":6148857,"winner":false,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"award_value":null,"entry_created_at":"2013-08-29T17:32:28+00:00","entry_feedback":{},"revisions":[{"additional_costs":{},"height":1790,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/0c/46e2e75100fa4ff6bc2792ab41924e76.jpg","width":2240,"created_at":"2013-08-29T17:32:28+00:00","id":6148857,"revision_number":216,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/48/817c1cb8e347405ab816cbfdff60582c.jpg"],"is_entirely_original":true,"entry":6148857,"description":"Hi There,\r\n\r\nPlease vie the electricity bill design and let us know your views.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hear back you soon with your valuable feedback.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nMohd.

LOVED the idea of injecting new life into a utility bill and I applaud your efforts to go out on a limb and experiment. I really hope I'm not too late to submit! If you like my concept, I'd be more than happy to tweak it to your satisfaction through the rather short remainder of the project duration (and or Project Wrap-Up if you REALLY like my work!)\r\n\r\nA few things struck me and stuck out during the research phase:\r\n- Customers are ok with charts and pictorial information, but they should convey USEFUL, actable information.\r\n\r\n- That large donut chart from Power 2Switch makes a great first impression, but really doesn't add much value to the bill. It's pretty, but many people felt it was too large and I agree. It presents information, but nothing which can be put to immediate use, and it's not obvious what all the charges are for. \r\n\r\n- More than pretty charts, your customers (and that of other power companies) want to know how to REDUCE their bills, so I tried to integrate several ways they can learn that from ComEd. (I'll go into detail in the next sections).\r\n\r\nDESIGN RATIONALE\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\nI wanted to create a design that highlighted and clearly defined the main sections of the bill while incorporating a visual aesthetic that is pleasing, yet functional and practical. \r\n\r\nLAYOUT AND INFORMATION HIERARCHY\r\nThis first design is more conservative in terms of layout, as I felt there shouldn't be too much of a shock for your existing customers when they transition from the old bill to the new. My hope is that after the initial first jolt due to change, they realize that info is pretty much where it used to be, but clearer and easier to understand. I elected to follow a similar hierarchy of info that the current bill presents, using design and color to highlight details that customers have said are important to them. E.g. Amount due and when to pay is highlighted in 3 ways: \r\n• it's in a bold red bar (ComEd Red is a subtle reminder who they pay to)\r\n• the white box within the red bar makes the text within jump out all the more (and having the amount in black means this can be easily laser printed) \r\n• fonts used are large and bold so even your oldest customers shouldn't have issues with legibility (unless they have major vision problems)\r\n\r\nAt a glance, your customers can see that all the bits highlighted in red are important:\r\n- account information (including account & meter numbers)\r\n- amount owed\r\n- when to pay\r\n- how costs are calculated (I used the red tabs and a simple math-formula style to show how things add up)\r\n\r\nIt's important that sensible sequence is established and the eye is led through information logically. To achieve this, I've also paired the red bars with customized icons to show what the information in each section is about. Accompanying titles are also bold and large so a quick glance is all that is needed to intuitively understand how information is laid out.\r\n\r\nCOST EFFECTIVENESS\r\nYou've been very generous, allowing us creatives to go wild and try anything. At the end of the day however, you\"ll have practical issues like costs to address, so I've tried to keep this in mind while not letting it be restrictive.\r\n\r\nI noted that your existing bill is Letter-size, and have maintained this for no-brainer transition and cost.\r\n\r\nCOLOR\r\nI've kept to a palette of 3 colors max. It's enough color to look good whether printed or sent as a PDF to customers. The design can also be easily rendered in 2-colors (ComEd red and greyscale) should costs need to be cut later, forcing design compromises. \r\n\r\nI've also designed things so text that is reverse white on red does NOT need to be changed monthly. This means that you could do a large print run of just the base color graphics, then laser print the rest with just black in any of your offices. (This sample has the bar chart in color, but if you like, I can also provide a version of this deign in just red and black so you can see how a more cost-effective version would look.) \r\n\r\nTHE COLOR BLIND\r\nIt was very tempting to go crazy with lot of colors, and I played around with that until I read a couple of posts on blogs that people who are color blind can have problems with lots of colors if they're not very carefully selected. Most of the color blind see a muddy range between blue, black and yellow. Those who can't see red, green or any color at all, are far fewer.\r\n\r\nI chose to use ComEd Red for branding purposes (if any color is to be used, it's got to be your red!) and shades of Cyan, as the blue spectrum is visible to a larger portion of the color blind. The combination is also pleasing. The red pops where we need pop, and blue soothes. Cyan also fades last (yellow goes first), and is thus a sensible choice as you'll have a pocket of customers who haven't yet caught up with the digital age, and will be referring to their old paper bills a lot. And there are some who just want paper copies of everything.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThe following lists comments I have on particular sections.\r\n\r\nMY ACCOUNT\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\nThis title bar is rendered in ComEd red as it encapsulates all the info a customer quickly needs to know:\r\n- their account number (clear and situated next to the ComEd phone numbers so they can refer and spot important info quickly when calling customer service)\r\n- their amount owed is in large, can't-miss-it bold font.\r\n- their payment deadline\r\n\r\nBright red bar + white box + bold, large font = can't miss that the most critical info is located here.\r\n\r\nMY METER\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\nThe way Power2Switch portrayed the meter info charges was clear and a vast improvement  from the current bill. I drew inspiration from the math formula layout as it's logical and effectively demystifies this section of the bill, and have also used this treatment whenever there are calculations that lead to the final bill total.\r\n\r\nMY USAGE\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\nI read posts from many consumers who wanted more info in the standard bar chart provided. My goal was to provide information that was easy to scan and comprehend, as well as have more useful info in a chart than any power provider details in their bill. This makes the ComEd bill USEFUL; something people will refer to (power-usage geeks anyway) as they can see general usage patterns over the last 18 months, as well as how they compare to:\r\n- the neighborhood average\r\n- their greenest neighbors\r\n\r\nNo doubt, some people will feel there's too much info in this chart, but for people who actually REFER to the charts in your bill, this will be much more informative. \r\n\r\nI also read many comments from people who wanted to know HOW they could reduce their power consumption. A detailed chart of usage patterns is the first step. I also added 2 more calls to action in this section to address the \"What can I do?\" customer.\r\n1.  A prompt in the section bar to log into their online accounts for details and the ability to play with an interactive chart (which isn't a current feature, but food for thought as you research changes to implement). \r\n2. A QR code people can scan that takes them to their online account. (Ran across this feature  request a couple of times) I also added an example of a service you can provide. \"Your bill this month is $___ or ___% higher than your neighbors. To learn how you can reduce your power bill, scan the code.\"\r\n\r\nI'm sure you've watched the TED Talk by Alex Laskey who discovered that people are only compelled to reduce their power consumption because their neighbors are doing it too. As paying less money is a common quest for all consumers, you can make 'How to Reduce Your Bill' a huge point of value that you offer. It could also be a great way to get a conversation going and build rapport with your customers.\r\n\r\nSome ideas for the interactive chart:\r\n- click a month bar to drill down and see a daily bar chart. \r\n- Click the daily chart to drill down into hourly usage so consumers can see at what times they consume the most power. Then have pop-ups that appear as people hover over various relevant sections of these charts, with tips to save energy, how to pick the best time to do the laundry, purchase cheaper power etc.\r\n\r\n- Hover over the 'greenest neighbors' or neighborhood average icon anywhere on the interactive chart for a pop-up that shows the usage by kWh & average price. Click for more info. Make this another gateway into other products or services you offer, e.g. your RRTP program. You could also invite people to sign up for a Smart Savings newsletter.\r\n\r\nMY SERVICE\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\nI felt that a donut chart showing the percentage of what's paid where isn't particularly helpful to consumers. Having the numbers broken down and itemized already gives people a good idea where their dollars go. It took me a few rounds of reading the details again and again, then some definition lookups and research to understand what this money is for, so I came up with an alternative visual aid.\r\n\r\nInstead of using a chart, I made an illustration which serves a few purposes:\r\n- it visually tells the story of where electricity comes from, how it's delivered to consumers, and gives customers an idea at which point the different charges are added to their bill\r\n- it brands the ComEd part of power delivery (please tell me if I got some part wrong/missed an important element)\r\n- in the first version of the design, it serves as the border between the main section of the bill and the tear away check mail-in section.\r\n- it's an unexpected sight in a utility bill, and lends a human touch/personal element. \r\n\r\nAMOUNT DUE\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\nYou requested that we see if we can integrate the various ways customers can pay their bills, and it made sense to put that right under how much they need to pay. \r\n\r\nMESSAGE CENTER\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\nThis is where your various messages go. I just formatted them for easier reading.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, I've also added sections to prompt customers to download your ComEd app, or get online if they don't understand their bills.\r\n\r\nI have a couple more design ideas and am racing to get them out.
