I am glad you liked the proposals.\r\n\r\nI created these proposal with a tagline to communicate within the design what Good Life Advocates does for people. Please let me know what you think or if you think of a better tagline and I would gladly change it.\r\n\r\nWhen I wrote “Social Services Case Management” I focused on communicating a rather formal, professional, corporate sounding message and when I wrote “Social Services Case Managers” I focused on communicating a rather personal, more emotional and connecting message. \r\n\r\nRegarding on what design to use, at the end of the contest you can keep and use all the designs. You could use one design at the time, that way you would have the work for future t-shirts already done or you could use some designs simultaneously and designate one design for each department within Good Life Advocates, designate another design for family of the people you serve or designate them as you find appropriate. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or suggestions regarding these proposals.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nDaniel M\r\nDigital_FX","is_entirely_original":false,"additional_costs":{},"width":1000,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/3c/fa26c927dd8f42cebabd720f6151b98c.jpg"]}],"offer_value":0.0,"entry_feedback":{},"tip_value":0.0,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"winner":false},{"author":2542414,"eliminated":false,"finalist":false,"withdrawn":false,"award_value":null,"author_username":"bazz2raju","project":2408076,"updated_at":"2017-07-10T16:03:19+00:00","entry_type":"image","id":8180405,"entry_created_at":"2017-07-09T19:21:33+00:00","entry_number":8,"revisions":[{"score":3,"created_at":"2017-07-09T19:21:33+00:00","height":800,"entry":8180405,"new":false,"id":8180405,"revision_number":8,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/61/e4338e9370484ff5879c6dcb1028d8d2.jpg","description":"LIFE EMPOWERED","is_entirely_original":true,"additional_costs":{},"width":801,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/cd/4da7cea2a87d477ba0c24af1bed91ff4.jpg"]}],"offer_value":0.0,"entry_feedback":{},"tip_value":0.0,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"winner":false},{"author":2542414,"eliminated":false,"finalist":false,"withdrawn":false,"award_value":null,"author_username":"bazz2raju","project":2408076,"updated_at":"2017-07-10T16:04:47+00:00","entry_type":"image","id":8180393,"entry_created_at":"2017-07-09T18:51:24+00:00","entry_number":7,"revisions":[{"score":3,"created_at":"2017-07-09T18:51:24+00:00","height":800,"entry":8180393,"new":false,"id":8180393,"revision_number":7,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/03/82fcc7d593484373813890da2bbf5a37.jpg","description":"Life is beautiful.","is_entirely_original":true,"additional_costs":{},"width":800,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/64/082d2438756243f794e12b8fc23970ca.jpg"]}],"offer_value":0.0,"entry_feedback":{},"tip_value":0.0,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"winner":false},{"author":2525546,"eliminated":false,"finalist":false,"withdrawn":false,"award_value":null,"author_username":"Ibrahim_H","project":2408076,"updated_at":"2017-07-10T16:06:02+00:00","entry_type":"image","id":8180283,"entry_created_at":"2017-07-09T14:45:38+00:00","entry_number":6,"revisions":[{"score":3,"created_at":"2017-07-09T14:45:38+00:00","height":800,"entry":8180283,"new":false,"id":8180283,"revision_number":6,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/1e/22ac610abc8947ad8919b404cfb37eca.jpg","description":"Hello,\r\n  I tried to go in a different direction here, where I made a cut of your logo on a cloud, which I think gives a sense of happiness, calmness and purity.
