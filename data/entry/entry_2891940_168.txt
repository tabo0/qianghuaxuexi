The logo must show seriousness, confidence and a certain modernity.\n\nThis is the reason why I allow myself to deviate from your brief by offering you not an ordinary logo with a cross that is rather related to the humanitarian or pharmacy because your practice is much more specific.\n\nSo I propose you a logo or the two initials of your activity name \"PhysioDoc\" is used in a simpler and wider way.\n\nThe logo is not used to tell a story and can never describe everything you do in your job.\n\nIt is therefore important to understand that what counts is to show that it is easily identifiable and quickly memorizable.\nThe simpler it is ... the more it will work.\n\nHere in this proposal I have worked on both initials \"P\" and \"D\" in order to show that the physiological activity and the \"doc\" aspect are combined in one practice.\n\nIf it suits you or if you want typographic and / or color adjustments, do not hesitate to tell me. I will make the changes quickly on request from you.\n\nIn the meantime, I remain at your disposal to finalize with you your project according to your every wish.\n\nBest regards,\n\nEmilie","id":9914710,"created_at":"2017-11-30T15:25:19.876243+00:00","revision_number":22,"height":947,"entry":9924969}],"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"award_value":null,"author_username":"SparkleDesign","tip_value":0.0,"eliminated":false,"entry_number":21,"id":9924969,"entry_feedback":{},"winner":false,"updated_at":"2017-12-01T08:19:45.834533+00:00"},{"entry_created_at":"2017-11-30T13:21:29.488527+00:00","author":2531232,"withdrawn":true,"project":2891940,"offer_value":0.0,"entry_type":"image","finalist":false,"revisions":[{"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/f8/f3677edd472a444e921c9b4a6acaaf1b.jpg"],"additional_costs":{"images":"","fonts":""},"width":800,"new":false,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/6d/a030cd73e82844fca7825053edc3cd11","score":3,"is_entirely_original":false,"description":"This design is created as per the brief of the Contest.","id":9914613,"created_at":"2017-11-30T13:21:34.270252+00:00","revision_number":19,"height":800,"entry":9924853}],"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"award_value":null,"author_username":"mita79_29","tip_value":0.0,"eliminated":false,"entry_number":19,"id":9924853,"entry_feedback":{"feedbackTextCheckbox":true,"feedback":"I like the different font strengths, but try grey scale, and less rounding on cross, no bones, thanks!
