Good luck getting exactly what you want Big Boss!\r\n\r\nSally","score":0,"is_entirely_original":true,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/a1/c513f64c00a24602847bcc058a455ab2.jpg"],"revision_number":44,"height":800,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/dd/5296748a0dab41fd8b5576b73d08ed2b.png"}],"award_value":null,"entry_created_at":"2011-03-18T18:30:55+00:00","updated_at":"2011-03-18T18:31:43+00:00","withdrawn":true,"tip_value":0.0,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"project":2293631,"entry_number":44,"author":33533,"finalist":false,"winner":false,"eliminated":false,"entry_feedback":{},"author_username":"ballysally","entry_type":"image","offer_value":0.0},{"id":3424830,"revisions":[{"id":3424830,"created_at":"2011-03-18T17:53:44+00:00","additional_costs":{},"width":800,"new":false,"entry":3424830,"description":"this is illustration of \"M\" which control the global business.","score":0,"is_entirely_original":false,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/e5/395db728d1eb451aa50d33f51ffd3604.jpg"],"revision_number":43,"height":800,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/50/23694962606e45c59294d7553ad04bc5.jpg"}],"award_value":null,"entry_created_at":"2011-03-18T17:53:44+00:00","updated_at":"2011-03-19T10:18:04+00:00","withdrawn":true,"tip_value":0.0,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"project":2293631,"entry_number":43,"author":2304894,"finalist":false,"winner":false,"eliminated":false,"entry_feedback":{},"author_username":"ipunk","entry_type":"image","offer_value":0.0},{"id":3424822,"revisions":[{"id":3424822,"created_at":"2011-03-18T17:51:09+00:00","additional_costs":{},"width":695,"new":false,"entry":3424822,"description":"hi,i have made an abstract of the brain ,which is show as green and blue as right and left sides of the brain,thanks.","score":3,"is_entirely_original":false,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/24/067d981c6a5847cfb059c2cc0a4d7948.jpg"],"revision_number":42,"height":420,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/0f/2ca3cd53441e44a78614945e5c47b77a.jpg"}],"award_value":null,"entry_created_at":"2011-03-18T17:51:09+00:00","updated_at":"2011-03-25T09:56:48+00:00","withdrawn":true,"tip_value":0.0,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"project":2293631,"entry_number":42,"author":2331348,"finalist":false,"winner":false,"eliminated":false,"entry_feedback":{},"author_username":"vyasa","entry_type":"image","offer_value":0.0},{"id":3424698,"revisions":[{"id":3424698,"created_at":"2011-03-18T17:17:30+00:00","additional_costs":{},"width":800,"new":false,"entry":3424698,"description":"I see mind like complicated and not investigated thing.
