My point here is : Apart form the color in the identity, its about how the identity adopts its color. Colors are beautiful, the whole world is of colors. But in the logo it is meant to be identified for its presence. Being a Graphic Designer for five years now, the toughest part in my job is designing an identity. What it has taught me is the importance of the identity is not only what it says about the firm or how it carries its character, but how it is recognized by the people for what it is in the next 15-20 years. An identity is what it talks about itself for what it is...and that is how it is recognized. \r\n\r\nThis is my entry. It is a balanced abstract form of 'BBH'. The logo alone can be recognized and also it looks much complete with the typeface along.

I wish we were together to discuss this. Anyway, i would like to say a few words. I don't believe in colors. For instance if you say 'Red' is for 'Danger' or 'Blue' is 'Corporate', I simply say its just the human senses which has carried it for a long time. The Fact - Colors speak many languages.
