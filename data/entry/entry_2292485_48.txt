If you tend to do a lot of longer form letters it tends to work better on the right, if you do more \"short\" memo type stuff with it, you can often get by with centering it.  Really just depends what type of primary correspondence you do, and I'd be happy to supply you with a file setup for both.  \r\n\r\nOn the web banner I just worked the box pattern into the background and then changed the color on the slogan to the right.

While they look similar they are actually rather different in their composition.  But I think that I was finally able to get the top closer to the power of the bottom image.  Color is always going to have a slightly different feel than the sharp contrast we can create with black and white, but I think by making the heart of the box \"white\" then we are able to carry the approachability of your organization into the brand.\r\n\r\nI really worked with the colors a lot.  While I like the blue and green that you recommended they (especially the green) can get a little \"pastel\" and passive.  So I tried to keep them more on the vibrant and sharp side of things.  \r\n\r\nOn the \"leadership\", I increased the font size a good bit, and coordinated it to the colors that bound the box or fill it (when possible).  That way it indicates that your organization is about the leadership that is inside (and eventually outside) of that box.  \r\n\r\nFor the bottom color logo I did it only in 2 color with the blue and green, but it also looks very powerful in single color and using white as the opposite color, with the blue or the green.\r\n\r\nOnce again, thank you for the terrific feedback.\r\n\r\nIf we like this design I'll move into mocking up the stationary and other things you desire.  \r\n\r\nAs always changes, feedback, etc are welcomed and appreciated!\r\n\r\nKen","score":4,"new":false}],"offer_value":0.0,"eliminated":false},{"author_username":"artlovka","withdrawn":false,"entry_number":28,"finalist":false,"author":2336238,"tip_value":0.0,"entry_type":"image","updated_at":"2011-02-16T17:44:58+00:00","project":2292485,"id":3329221,"winner":false,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"award_value":null,"entry_created_at":"2011-02-16T11:31:21+00:00","entry_feedback":{},"revisions":[{"additional_costs":{},"height":800,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/ac/ce48bc7f7adf45598cc624408188f194.jpg","width":800,"created_at":"2011-02-16T11:31:21+00:00","id":3329221,"revision_number":28,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/a6/c96020b5bc884557b2fcaaf01f340144.jpg"],"is_entirely_original":false,"entry":3329221,"description":"It's a simple design, because I don't want to disturb white space where the texts will be stay.","score":2,"new":false}],"offer_value":0.0,"eliminated":false},{"author_username":"artlovka","withdrawn":false,"entry_number":27,"finalist":false,"author":2336238,"tip_value":0.0,"entry_type":"image","updated_at":"2011-02-16T17:46:47+00:00","project":2292485,"id":3329211,"winner":false,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"award_value":null,"entry_created_at":"2011-02-16T11:27:09+00:00","entry_feedback":{},"revisions":[{"additional_costs":{},"height":800,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/7b/4cab1289294b413dbab8e227037c1623.jpg","width":800,"created_at":"2011-02-16T11:27:09+00:00","id":3329211,"revision_number":27,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/61/24d4e826466c402bac69288c91601626.jpg"],"is_entirely_original":false,"entry":3329211,"description":"The contents of biz card are logo, image watermark, and a little shape on the bottom","score":3,"new":false}],"offer_value":0.0,"eliminated":false},{"author_username":"artlovka","withdrawn":false,"entry_number":26,"finalist":false,"author":2336238,"tip_value":0.0,"entry_type":"image","updated_at":"2011-02-16T17:18:11+00:00","project":2292485,"id":3329207,"winner":false,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"award_value":null,"entry_created_at":"2011-02-16T11:25:09+00:00","entry_feedback":{},"revisions":[{"additional_costs":{},"height":800,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/2e/a841bfbc6b4146bd9f694581892866b9.jpg","width":800,"created_at":"2011-02-16T11:25:09+00:00","id":3329207,"revision_number":26,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/d2/2955538b8ad94fee819e5ecf6f5f0103.jpg"],"is_entirely_original":false,"entry":3329207,"description":"This logo inspired by a multiple electric plug.
