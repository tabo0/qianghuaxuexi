Redesigning an existing already established brand can be a tricky exercise: you want to update and refresh the look, but also keep enough consistency with your old branding elements. Your customers have grown accustomed to the appearance of your logo and packaging design, and you don't want them confused at the point of purchase.\r\n\r\nMy proposed re-branding offers consistency with some of your previous branding elements:\r\n- lower-case sans serif font typeface with rounded appearance\r\n- \"leaf\" elements to supplement the typeface design\r\n- familiar colors green and teal\r\n\r\nUsing these elements, here is a fresh updated look: a contemporary typeface, which is not only professional and easy to read, but also \"friendly\" (i.e. not sterile looking - giving a sense of being \"\"natural\"\" without looking too \"hippie\"), while at the same time invoking a sense of \"clean\", \"trustworthy\" and \"safe\", which are essential to your particular line of business.\r\n\r\nConventional leaf-logo designs have been hugely overused, but the leaf is still the best possible graphic element to provide a sense of \"natural\" products.  As such, I give you your very own unique tri-foil leaf icon branding element to supplement the typeface design, and to provide color accents.  The tri-foil leaf icon can also be used as a separate branding element on packaging, web, app icon, and print design, such as shown here.  The tri-foil leaf can also feaature different color schemes for different product line sub-identities and packaging - some may venture more into the purple or blue realm, other product lines may be better served with warmer colors.\r\n\r\nThe new branding works well on both, dark or light background applications, and also as single-color version.
