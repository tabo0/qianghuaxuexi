You are a talented artist. Please make those corrections. Yes, the focal point of the cover is NOT the eagle or banner, but the SHIELD. Thank you so much.

However, I like the previous color scheme for the title, up top. The eagle is much better, but can you please lower its wings, as if it's sort of providing a protection of the shield. The shield still needs to be much larger, and the eagle just slightly smaller. The blue sapphire needs to have a deep, rich color, and needs to be larger and more radiant with actual facets. When we see it, we must say. \"wow! that's a sapphire!!\" As for the author name and the bottom text, I don't like white.. I would love something dark and rich. Yes, a much larger shield :) right in the center. Let it really jump out.

Nice work. Here are the corrections: 1. The eagle should be depicted as something holy, more like the Holy Spirit, that is WHITE and not menacing, rather as a protective, angelic presence. Also, the eagle is much too big. The shield needs more saturated colors and needs to be much larger. So the proportions are off. I want a more prominent shield and a smaller eagle. Please remove the Fleur-de-lis symbols in the background (not good). The blue sapphire needs to much more prominent and A DEEP RADIANT blue/purple. Christ Destiny needs to be slightly larger. I need the author name. No quotation marks for the donation line. This bottom lines should be dark, I don't like the white lettering there. On the positive, I like the shield very much (if only larger and with rich colors), and I like the title and sub-title fonts and placement. Please remember, this is a highly elegant and highly spiritual book... yes, the eagle needs to be a all WHITE (angel like) and made smaller in proportion to the shield. Thank you, again. You are very talented.
