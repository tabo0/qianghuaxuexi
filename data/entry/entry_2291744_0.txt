The first one is really close to your drawings. I just changed the shape of the footer a little bit. The edges are rounded and it's painted white. I think that this fits better. All the other materials are not changed. At the second version of the POP display I changed the display a little bit more. I wanted to integrate the green colour . In addition I wanted to get more focus on the obelisk and the idea that it rises up to the product. So I decided to change the shape of the display. To my mind this is a real alternative because it keeps very much attention (green colour, obelisk...) and it look a little bit like a diagram. You may use the \"green body\" to print additional informations on it (benefits, advantages, features).
