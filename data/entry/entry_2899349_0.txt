The designs are for iPhone 6 to 8, but for the display purpose I have scaled it down a bit. \n\nLet me walk you through all the screens:\n\nFirst column, first screen. It is the homescreen with the category menu and logo+tagline on top and a search field. Then we have user pic and basic info alongwith settings and favorites button followed by featured offers. Then we have the bottom navigation.\n\nNow the first column second image is to explain how the search field will behave when user starts typing. When he/she types \"pizza\" in, then we can auto suggest user with the restaurants which has pizza in it's name / as a category. I have also highlighted how the bottom tabs will behave when a particular section is active.\n\n-------\n\nSecond column, first screen.It is the multiple business display. We will show how many results are there as a heading right after the search bar. I am also suggesting to have a filter to refine the search results if the user want to do so. Then we have results/individual business listing. We have categories in which the property is listed, name, logo, address, phone, favorite icon, rating, map icon, distance and then main C2A - order now and secondary C2As coupons and saver advt. I believe even with so much information, it is clean and readable. I thought of having the phone number and addres right here because as a user, I would love to know maximum information without having to click one more time.\n\nNow second column second image. This is just to explain how the filters would work if you will implement it in the app. This will be a user initiated action. So every time user selects a particular filter, the apply button will be active and user will click on it to refine the results below. I have also shown how the favorite button will look like if the restaurant has been added to my favorite section.\n\n-------\n\nThird column, first image. THis is the detail page. On top we have four icons. I have used generic icons so that we can get away with the labels as user can identify them easily. Favorites, direction/map, share and click to call.\n\nBelow that we have top level information about the restaurant. Then we have the main call to action. Below that we have uber and COTA buttons. Then we have additional informations. Then I have put a section for reviews. We will show only top 3 or 5 reviews here with a view all button and another button to write a new review. Clicking on that will either open up a new screen or we can open a popup.\n\nThird column second image will show how the popup will look like if user click to see the opening hours of that particular restaurant. It will be opened if the user click on \"view all\" link beside the timing on top section of the detail page (third column first image)\n\nNow last column first image will explain how the pop up will look like f th user opens up a saver advt. The second image is to show how the share button will work (share icon is on top of the detail page). We do not need to make additional functionality for that. We can use the default property of iOs /Android for that. So whatever options/social media has in user's device, will open up and user will just have to decide where to share it.\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts.\n\n\nRegards,\nNayana","id":10030444,"created_at":"2018-06-02T23:35:57.325875+00:00","revision_number":26,"height":2999,"entry":10053888}],"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"award_value":null,"author_username":"jayanayana","tip_value":0.0,"eliminated":false,"entry_number":24,"id":10053888,"entry_feedback":{},"winner":false,"updated_at":"2018-06-02T23:35:57.303293+00:00"},{"entry_created_at":"2018-06-02T21:22:11.900296+00:00","author":2536709,"withdrawn":false,"project":2899349,"offer_value":0.0,"entry_type":"image","finalist":false,"revisions":[{"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/1e/205dad2fd07242b0937d2410f563c95b.jpg"],"additional_costs":{"images":0,"fonts":""},"width":5380,"new":false,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/dc/1e9a6b11bea84e6ca811c203117eed3d","score":1,"is_entirely_original":false,"description":"Hi, In this design I made the app logo, icon and splash screen in the first part. I made the login and homepage on the second screen. In the home page, I am not thinking only UI I thought UX part also. So I made the app screen very minimal way. I made the categories in top strip. that strip is like swipe functionality. At the same time, I created in hamburger menu also. so the user can navigate through swipe or user via hamburger menu.\n It will help to make the code better and more elegant.  3 part is the list of businesses. 4 part is the food shop details, Menu, and reviews.\n\nOnce You ok with this design I will give you complete prototype in Invision. Invision is the best one tool for communication of UI design and development douts. In industry, all people are using Invision. So, it will help to move forward to the design.\n\nSo In the final version of the design, I will hand over to the all the screens in iPhone 6,8, X and Android.

Don't be discouraged by the length of comments I've made, I really like what I see.\n\nI'm also wondering what other possibilities there are for coming up with a different layout which would include the items you are missing (I'll point those out) without causing the page to look overly crowded.\n\nI love your use of color, you stuck to the scarlet & gray which is exactly what I wanted.  If you want to add another color then I'd suggest black.  I also like your choice of fonts.\n\nHere are specific changes I'd like to see:\nHome Page:\n- Remove Ohio State University, all the users are around the OSU area.\n- You can give a little less room for the entire profile section.\n- Move the \"profile settings\" button a little to the right.\n- I'd like you to add a \"Categories\" button which will just slide out the list from the left side of the screen.  I realize the three lines already give that functionality but the user may not know that.  You can even put something like \"View Categories\" next to the lines if you like.\n\nList of Businesses Page:\n- While many of the logos include the business' names, I need you to add a field for the business name.  Some logos either don't include their name or the name will be too small to read.\n- Did you intentionally leave off the \"View Saver Ad\" button because it was getting too crowded?\n- I think it's best that you left off the icon for linking to the client's site.  It will definitely be getting too crowded.\n- I don't like the Now Open and Now Closed icons.  Also, put now before open or closed please.\n- The address and phone are too close to each other.  User will have a hard time clicking on the right one on their phone.  Also, what is the icon for next to the address?\n- Please change the Order Now icon, it is for placing an order online and not for placing a phone call.\n- Some businesses can be listed under 4 or 5 categories so it won't fit on one line.  I'm not sure what implications that will have on the layout.\n\nSingle Business Listing Page:\n- This is the page I didn't like the layout of as much, please rework it.  I'd also like to see more attractive buttons, each with an icon.\n- I think you should get rid of the map.  The reality is that most of the users will know where businesses they're selecting are located.  If not then they can easily click on the map button.\n- The distance and \"Get Directions\" button should be more closely tied together instead of being shown as two different elements.  There should be just one icon instead of two different ones like you currently have it.\n- If you have room I'm thinking it may be nice to have a separate button for \"Map\", which is different from directions.\n- Replace the Now Open icon and move today's hours so it's closer to this icon.  I want the user to be able to click on something to have the hours for the week come up.\n- You need to add a Rewards button.  That button will be different from the Rewards button at the bottom of the page.  This button will explain the rewards program for this specific business and state how many points you have for just their business.  The button at the bottom of the page will display your rewards points at ALL the businesses.\n- I need a \"View Our Saver Ad\" button\n- I need a share with friends button.  This button will share this specific business.  The one at the bottom of the screen will share my app with others.\n- I don't like the Uber and COTA buttons, I need something more interesting.\n- I'd like to see an icon in the order now button.  It could be the same icon as you have on the bottom of the page.  This button will take the user to this specific business' online ordering page.\n- Make the Reviews button more visible and put a number next to their score, like 4.7."},"winner":false,"updated_at":"2018-05-31T12:30:18.143250+00:00"},{"entry_created_at":"2018-06-03T00:32:44.287308+00:00","author":2132036,"withdrawn":true,"project":2899349,"offer_value":0.0,"entry_type":"image","finalist":false,"revisions":[{"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/32/3ce7aa21855543c48ec04f3c8e1f94f7.jpg"],"additional_costs":{"images":"","fonts":""},"width":2000,"new":false,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/4b/da830fc6a9424bc3a38c75f258ae37d4","score":2,"is_entirely_original":true,"description":"Hi there.\nI worked on nice and clean pixel perfect UX/UI proposal.\nBest","id":10030456,"created_at":"2018-06-03T00:32:44.310001+00:00","revision_number":28,"height":5054,"entry":10053898}],"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"award_value":null,"author_username":"pecho","tip_value":0.0,"eliminated":false,"entry_number":25,"id":10053898,"entry_feedback":{"composition":true,"brief_requirements":true},"winner":false,"updated_at":"2018-06-03T10:48:55.146602+00:00"},{"entry_created_at":"2018-06-02T21:37:18.296129+00:00","author":2338447,"withdrawn":true,"project":2899349,"offer_value":0.0,"entry_type":"image","finalist":false,"revisions":[{"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/45/ad670c823f474bec878fd24a51afefd9.jpg"],"additional_costs":{"images":"","fonts":""},"width":2000,"new":false,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/e0/e5585975e7544e85a3d2fb1c590bfca6","score":3,"is_entirely_original":true,"description":"Hi,\nHere I submit my entry of The Saver app design contest.\n\nIf my design is still far from that you would expect,\nplease you will be able to give some suggestions in your feedback.\n\nKind Regards,\nMac","id":10030406,"created_at":"2018-06-02T21:37:18.342093+00:00","revision_number":25,"height":2000,"entry":10053846}],"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"award_value":null,"author_username":"MacArvy","tip_value":0.0,"eliminated":false,"entry_number":23,"id":10053846,"entry_feedback":{},"winner":false,"updated_at":"2018-06-03T15:35:39.857781+00:00"},{"entry_created_at":"2018-06-02T15:22:40.544556+00:00","author":2522961,"withdrawn":true,"project":2899349,"offer_value":0.0,"entry_type":"image","finalist":false,"revisions":[{"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/80/db976ba918fc4c61bee0d56326199c88.jpg"],"additional_costs":{"images":"","fonts":""},"width":1856,"new":false,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/ee/77e66e67bfbd44a4baddd1156cc5a4ef","score":2,"is_entirely_original":true,"description":"Please let me know now, I meet your idea about this design.","id":10030215,"created_at":"2018-06-02T15:22:40.567142+00:00","revision_number":21,"height":1999,"entry":10053663}],"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"award_value":null,"author_username":"jpwork","tip_value":0.0,"eliminated":false,"entry_number":19,"id":10053663,"entry_feedback":{},"winner":false,"updated_at":"2018-06-03T01:52:19.232828+00:00"}]}
