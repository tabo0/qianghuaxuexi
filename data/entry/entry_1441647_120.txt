everyone!\r\n\r\ni've read through all the comments, and had a couple new ideas. i will also make some revisions to the ones that seem like they are on the right track with a few tweaks.\r\n\r\nit seemed like the \"open circle\" idea was well received, it was just missing an human element, and the swirly plant life was lacking for some. so instead of being cliche and putting in a person, i thought i could make a tree using a finger print as the leaves.\r\n\r\nthis design doesn't work well in a circle, but i think the integrity of the concept still remains, with the branches extending out of the box. i also think the font from the circle works well under the rectangle, and allows for a little playfulness with the mix up of words under the straight edges.\r\n\r\ni also took the color scheme from the box option that everyone seemed to like (except for the swirls), so you have some nice depth in color, but this still would make a strong impact in b/w too.\r\n\r\nplease keep
