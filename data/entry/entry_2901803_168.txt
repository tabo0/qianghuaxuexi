Lets try some tweeks. The bent H must have the same pitch as the shield. It might already, but it looks different. Maybe spacing the H a little wider will fix that. Lets try a more sophisticated font with serifs. Try red color on the o in now. It will draw attention to that part possibly, emphasize quickness. I know that was not in the description. We defiantly need to change the red color. It is too close to blood red. Please do not withdraw any of your previous work. I have a partner whom I need his feed back on as well.\nI think I would like to try the shield with a little straight side from the roof angle, then curved to a point. Some of the old shields had that. Do you see the little piece after the roof angle before the white spce  over the S, that little part make it 90 degrees straight down and do a little oiece the same after the S. By the way, the whit space above the S and below the S are not the same. Use the larger size on the bottom. I am not sure why, but the Home and now look modern and good, Savers looks more plain, old almost salvation army. It makes me think poor. I would like the more modern feel. Maybe a different font style on all with the same uniqueness. The one thing I do not want is to have different fonts for the name. It has a lot going on and I do not want to complicate it more."}},{"author_username":"cikruh","entry_number":18,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"entry_type":"image","updated_at":"2018-08-18T01:28:52.002497+00:00","winner":false,"eliminated":false,"finalist":false,"id":10102499,"author":3062326,"withdrawn":true,"tip_value":0.0,"revisions":[{"image":"https://crowdspring3-production.s3.amazonaws.com/project_entries/ec/1225e008d0844c2199f3090bff17a0f3","new":false,"description":"I have the letter \"HomeSaversNow\" into stylized logo mark with shield as rescue from foreclosure icon.\nThe letter \"o\" with arrow as keep the house and repurchase icon, the \"Shield\" as rescue from foreclosure icon and the letter \"Checkmark\" as trustworthy icon.\nThis icon is showing Trust, Hope and Integrity.\nI hope you really like it...","height":800,"width":800,"id":10073203,"additional_costs":{"fonts":"","images":""},"entry":10102499,"revision_number":18,"is_entirely_original":true,"created_at":"2018-08-15T02:33:50.970845+00:00","score":4,"thumbnails":["https://crowdspring3-production.s3.amazonaws.com/project_entries/6a/fa1ea800a5d3453ea8969d5c74b5946b.jpg"]}],"entry_created_at":"2018-08-15T02:33:50.953410+00:00","offer_value":0.0,"award_value":null,"project":2901803,"entry_feedback":{"feedback":"I am not a fan of the check mark.
