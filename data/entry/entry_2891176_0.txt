The type of clothes, the clothes cut, and the destruction of clothes. A great advantage is that it can be worn with delicate ladies dresses or people without clothing. In critical moments it can be put on the neck and sometimes as headphones - it's fun for young people. There are possibilities to produce in different colors, and the metal color is versatile.\nMy idea is raw but it has the ability to improve. For example, the point where the magnet element is connected to the bus may be flexible and this allows the position to change at a different angle. This is an ergonomic function applicable in cases such as ladies with a larger bust and people with XXXL bodies.\nRegarding the problem: Wasted sheets (i.e. only need 2 name badges out of a sheet that has 8 name badges. There are no other possibilities when using this method. One solution is to use a digital badge.","is_entirely_original":true,"additional_costs":{"images":"","fonts":""},"width":1024,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/17/1e97fc65b75b4540b1009954335b4e20.jpg"]}],"offer_value":100.0,"entry_feedback":{"feedback":"Thanks!"},"tip_value":0.0,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"winner":false},{"author":2523003,"eliminated":false,"finalist":false,"withdrawn":false,"award_value":null,"author_username":"ideazone","project":2891176,"updated_at":"2017-11-05T15:10:48.613190+00:00","entry_type":"image","id":9900298,"entry_created_at":"2017-10-24T18:19:18.161420+00:00","entry_number":12,"revisions":[{"score":4,"created_at":"2017-10-24T18:19:22.242593+00:00","height":1181,"entry":9900298,"new":false,"id":9894285,"revision_number":13,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/c9/35288b4bec7845baa0f94da139411413","description":"Hi,\nthis is my new badge design.\nIt's innovative, smart and simple, very easy to wear, to be positioned and very permissive to be adjustated. \nThe whole system is consisting of 2 magnetic buttons (dots) linked through a texile cord that keeps together the 2 magnets (don't lost one from another) and also help to fix and position the badge in the wished place.
