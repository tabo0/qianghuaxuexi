was trying to make this design as simple as possible and let the art speak for it self. I've put a fragment of the painting which I feel gives a great invitation to the rest of the book. Picture is zoomed , so that it’s possible to see paintings texture and brush strokes .This way we have the feeling of  hand crafted art as appose to digital picture. Painting is cropped in a way to make the best balance on the page . I also feel that this frame creates an atmosphere of some mysterious deep space.\r\n  \tI’ve put additional font because I feel that the title and background image  are integral and create the main point of  focus. The rest is a descriptive part that’s why it’s in different font.\r\nI also had to change the author’s picture color scheme because it does not exactly fits the colors of the painting and that creates certain distortion. I think other solution, is to just make this picture black and white.\r\nSorry I couldn’t  participate earlier , hope this submission is not to late. Please leave some feedback.\r\n\t\t\t\tBest Regards Mat","additional_costs":{},"score":0,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/93/da6173fdcd1d4435aa34ad14a50e74f6.jpg"],"created_at":"2011-02-18T07:03:59+00:00","new":false,"entry":3335097,"id":3335097,"height":800}],"tip_value":0.0,"award_value":null,"entry_created_at":"2011-02-18T07:03:59+00:00","eliminated":false,"author_username":"ied","project":2292130,"id":3335097,"entry_feedback":{}},{"offer_value":0.0,"winner":false,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"author":2328995,"updated_at":"2011-02-18T07:03:50+00:00","withdrawn":false,"entry_type":"image","finalist":false,"entry_number":195,"revisions":[{"width":800,"revision_number":195,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/f5/38da9b29c42e4ab699de74764000c416.png","is_entirely_original":false,"description":"Hello\r\n\r\nI was trying to make this design as simple as possible and let the art speak for it self .
