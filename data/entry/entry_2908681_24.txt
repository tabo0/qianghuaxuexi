I might adjust some things like 1) the character's right ear is lighter than the rest of the skin on the face, so it looks off. Perhaps this could be fire-scorched as well, or at least shaded darker, and 2) the font on the author's name is thin - bold it.\n\nOtherwise, my decision here is with the character itself. I like the look of it, and it does partially match either the MC's final situation at the end, OR one of the earlier characters of the fire-eater/archer. But no one in the story wears a top hat, and none of the MCs have a beard. So if there's something you can do about that, fine, but otherwise I need to decide if I want to adjust the story to accommodate the cover art."},"finalist":false,"eliminated":false,"author_username":"Wilson_Fernando","entry_created_at":"2019-02-09T21:50:39.861318+00:00","revisions":[{"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/e5/dd870401602e4e07a5fd317456d00208","entry":10211617,"width":984,"score":4,"created_at":"2019-02-09T21:50:39.881036+00:00","revision_number":7,"is_entirely_original":false,"new":false,"id":10167404,"description":"Hi there Andy follows flat design as requested.
