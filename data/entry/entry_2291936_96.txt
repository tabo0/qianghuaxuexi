I used cursor arrows (as yours is predominantly an online site) and had them 'bursting' out of a circular element - the 5 cursors represent different members of the community all working together.\n\nThe overall effect of the logo is a high energy design which is still professional but not too conservative or stuffy.\n\nI opted for a bold colour scheme of purple coupled with a green which gives a result which is vibrant, clean and modern.\n\nI coupled the graphic with a font that is clean and clear as you stated in your brief. Of course the colour scheme can be easily modified as per your preference, as can the font used also.\n\nThe logo works well against light or dark backgrounds as well as in black or white variants.\n\nThe favicon can be seen in the upper right section of the entry, and in use in the taskbar recreation - if chosen this will of course be included in the final deliverable files.\n\nLet me know what your thoughts are on this and of any suggestions you might have for possible improvements or modifications.\n\nThanks for your time and consideration,\n\nCal","score":3,"new":false}],"offer_value":0.0,"eliminated":false},{"author_username":"PisanQueues","withdrawn":true,"entry_number":10,"finalist":false,"author":2316287,"tip_value":0.0,"entry_type":"image","updated_at":"2011-01-25T23:11:35+00:00","project":2291936,"id":3263867,"winner":false,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"award_value":null,"entry_created_at":"2011-01-25T18:23:25+00:00","entry_feedback":{},"revisions":[{"additional_costs":{},"height":800,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/bc/707e8436755a46fcb74d1b06ac384319.png","width":800,"created_at":"2011-01-25T18:23:25+00:00","id":3263867,"revision_number":10,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/19/c904c50c978b4300ba8bb45912bcbdc4.jpg"],"is_entirely_original":true,"entry":3263867,"description":"allowing
