However the grid can be scrolled horizontally (Feeds) and vertically (entries). \r\n\r\nTapping the entry opens it's details. \r\nOne-time vert. and hor. scrolling is impossible. It is made like app screenshots in AppStore. But here you scroll horizontally the feeds first. The view snaps to screen edges and after, you can \r\n\r\nscroll vertically. Simple and easy\r\n\r\nQuick filter (filter icon) allows modifying of current display. For example only economic news from all feeds or only few feeds.\r\n\r\nUser can create it's own feeds and set up the feed colours (select one from predefined palette). Actually, this is one of tha main App features, as i understand.\r\nSome feeds are predefiend and can be customized. All this is done in Settings popover wich opens on tapping the gear icon.\r\n\r\nEach entry can be closed (x icon) or checked for action (square icon). Also the entire feed may be checked for action or be closed.

I haven't had much time to work on it. What I am uploading may be a fancy wireframe.\r\n\r\nHere are my ideas:\r\n1. On the header, the user has the option to select the view they want. (ex. icons, thumbnails, lists)\r\n\r\n2. On the header, the user has the capabilities to edit/add the groups.\r\n\r\n3. On the header there is a search option.\r\n\r\n4. The groups will be displayed in columns (I think this works best for viewing on the iPad horizontally and vertically)\r\n\r\n5. The information will be in cells, some with images, some just text, depending on the content.\r\n\r\n6. A user can have an almost unlimited number of groups. They can navigate these group columns much like one navigates the app icons on an iphone. At the bottom you can see the number of pages and where one is.\r\n\r\n7. In each content cell there is a zoom/+ icon that will take the user to the main content.\r\n\r\nI think it is simple, clean and very familiar and comfortable from a UX perspective.\r\n\r\nI am out of time to develop it further before the close of the project, but if you like where my head is at, I am available to take it to the next level this week and next week, once the project is awarded.\r\n\r\nI have over 11 years experience and I am passionate about UX. \r\n\r\nI have been working on complex financial web applications for Cisco and Goldman Sachs for the past few years. Now I am eager to move beyond the finance sector and work independently with new and exciting clients.\r\n\r\nI would REALLY love to develop an awesome iPad piece for my book. I would be 110% committed.\r\n\r\nI am located in Southern California, that is my time zone, but we can communicate at anytime. I am flexible.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your feedback. Thank you for the opportunity and Good Luck!\r\n\r\n-Janette","score":3,"is_entirely_original":true,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/f6/3ef7ca3ae601427fa60703b7297246f5.jpg"],"revision_number":31,"height":1100,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/d7/75968787111240ddb59b6b7bbc6b6171.png"}],"award_value":null,"entry_created_at":"2011-03-22T08:25:57+00:00","updated_at":"2011-04-06T21:15:44+00:00","withdrawn":true,"tip_value":0.0,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"project":2293388,"entry_number":31,"author":2292863,"finalist":false,"winner":false,"eliminated":false,"entry_feedback":{},"author_username":"FlyFish","entry_type":"image","offer_value":0.0},{"id":3427520,"revisions":[{"id":3427520,"created_at":"2011-03-19T17:20:53+00:00","additional_costs":{},"width":800,"new":false,"entry":3427520,"description":"app","score":1,"is_entirely_original":true,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/74/a2f86842828b4868a95159c613e254d2.jpg"],"revision_number":17,"height":800,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/4f/df32eb6b825147fa856e370d2e96339e.jpg"}],"award_value":null,"entry_created_at":"2011-03-19T17:20:53+00:00","updated_at":"2011-03-29T23:15:15+00:00","withdrawn":true,"tip_value":0.0,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"project":2293388,"entry_number":17,"author":2211113,"finalist":false,"winner":false,"eliminated":false,"entry_feedback":{},"author_username":"milicavukicevic","entry_type":"image","offer_value":0.0},{"id":3427455,"revisions":[{"id":3427455,"created_at":"2011-03-19T16:56:01+00:00","additional_costs":{},"width":800,"new":false,"entry":3427455,"description":"app","score":1,"is_entirely_original":true,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/33/18bc8217856b463f93598f04ec2ce3b6.jpg"],"revision_number":16,"height":800,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/61/ade5a4d60b484ba08452111bc5d512b2.jpg"}],"award_value":null,"entry_created_at":"2011-03-19T16:56:01+00:00","updated_at":"2011-03-29T23:15:18+00:00","withdrawn":true,"tip_value":0.0,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"project":2293388,"entry_number":16,"author":2211113,"finalist":false,"winner":false,"eliminated":false,"entry_feedback":{},"author_username":"milicavukicevic","entry_type":"image","offer_value":0.0},{"id":3424792,"revisions":[{"id":3424792,"created_at":"2011-03-18T17:39:58+00:00","additional_costs":{},"width":1600,"new":false,"entry":3424792,"description":"Hi there","score":1,"is_entirely_original":false,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/aa/aabf16511bd44118858eeed6bc6b7fc1.jpg"],"revision_number":15,"height":1100,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/87/8b0abb03a3df4016b28e070feb3c6007.jpg"}],"award_value":null,"entry_created_at":"2011-03-18T17:39:58+00:00","updated_at":"2011-03-21T14:29:57+00:00","withdrawn":true,"tip_value":0.0,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"project":2293388,"entry_number":15,"author":2132036,"finalist":false,"winner":false,"eliminated":false,"entry_feedback":{},"author_username":"pecho","entry_type":"image","offer_value":0.0},{"id":3418013,"revisions":[{"id":3418013,"created_at":"2011-03-16T17:28:30+00:00","additional_costs":{},"width":800,"new":false,"entry":3418013,"description":"app","score":1,"is_entirely_original":true,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/21/96a370fb469f46d083d1b0de788b9ec9.jpg"],"revision_number":11,"height":800,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/eb/8de1c7a9e1eb4396be31b1675546cf2b.jpg"}],"award_value":null,"entry_created_at":"2011-03-16T17:28:30+00:00","updated_at":"2011-03-29T23:15:50+00:00","withdrawn":true,"tip_value":0.0,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"project":2293388,"entry_number":11,"author":2211113,"finalist":false,"winner":false,"eliminated":false,"entry_feedback":{},"author_username":"milicavukicevic","entry_type":"image","offer_value":0.0}]}
