In essence, it's a cardboard folding card with the center section of the pick proud of the packaging. Glue around the top and sides to keep everything buttoned up (or you could use a sticker or something at the top. Sticker and the pick slide in and you're good to go! should be easy to package and easy to ship without damage to the product. \n\nI mocked up the graphics a little but I just put something down quick to get the idea across. I like the idea of a handwritten, authentic illustration style to explain the product. Gives it a personable, high quality feel but still down to earth. Easy to open and is recyclable!\n\nLet me know what you think! :D","is_entirely_original":true,"additional_costs":{"images":"","fonts":""},"width":3000,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/ca/e671e48311b648eb9780b670471e05ef.jpg"]},{"score":4,"created_at":"2018-07-23T20:25:33.194509+00:00","height":2000,"entry":10088153,"new":false,"id":10060831,"revision_number":3,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/29/42ce33c3abab4a17a2c8dbdc9fc157a4","description":"Hey there! I wanted to get these down quick and sent out to you so you can review. I hope my drawing and explanation combo help to illustrate my ideas. Tried to stay away from traditional fastening methods like you had suggested (blister packs, twist ties, etc.) but keep the experience similar so they know what they're doing. My focus was on making sure the user has the ability to touch and feel the product. I think that (and as you all said) is the most important part especially when the product is so new and unique. \n\nIdea #1: idea revolves around keeping the pick open for users to try out and get a feel for it. I think that's a really unique way to sell the product! A heavy duty screw on cable keyring goes through the center and gets wrapped up in a brown craft paper/paperboard hang tag. A sticker has a die-cut hole that also fits on the keyring!\n\nIdea #2: A little bit more like your alls idea. A plastic die-cut outer casing folds and snaps to itself and captures the pick, the sticker, and the backing for the brand and description of the product. I think you could rely on the snap to keep things closed but you could add a bit of adhesive to seal it tight. \n\nIdea #3: Kind of a riff off of the first idea but with a more natural or earth vibe. I like the idea of a rope keeping everything together! Still keeps the pick out and about for people to gets touchy with along with the rope securing the pick to the hang tang where the rope also keeps the hang tag closed which captures the sticker. \n\nI personally think idea #2 and #3 feel the most interesting to me. I'd love to get your opinions and feedback! Hopefully, I'm not too late to this party to get you all a final submission!\n\nThanks and Talk soon!\n\nAlex","is_entirely_original":true,"additional_costs":{"images":"","fonts":""},"width":3000,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/c9/8e79a4a0c0e2418c9187e36dac84ae57.jpg"]}],"offer_value":0.0,"entry_feedback":{"feedback":"I see where you're going with this - it's interesting."},"tip_value":0.0,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"winner":false},{"author":2544831,"eliminated":true,"finalist":false,"withdrawn":false,"award_value":null,"author_username":"Design2Sage","project":2901147,"updated_at":"2018-07-19T04:47:05.027908+00:00","entry_type":"image","id":10085435,"entry_created_at":"2018-07-19T04:47:05.027902+00:00","entry_number":2,"revisions":[{"score":1,"created_at":"2018-07-19T04:47:05.043982+00:00","height":1826,"entry":10085435,"new":false,"id":10058656,"revision_number":2,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/59/e3099ca779994708903664c7fc1a1d32","description":"This is an origami folded package that looks like a guitar.\n If you like this, I will send you folding instructions.","is_entirely_original":false,"additional_costs":{"images":0,"fonts":0},"width":1498,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/93/99f12a222eec4cbea0d2f749917c2396.jpg"]}],"offer_value":0.0,"entry_feedback":{},"tip_value":0.0,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"winner":false}]}
