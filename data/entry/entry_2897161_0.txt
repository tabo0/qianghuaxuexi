(if reproduced in future just switch to 4115, 4117)\nMy proposal is to offer a QR code (or several of them) that links to the tree web page (if it exists) or some local tourist resource. Alternatively QR code may contain text only (this particular one says just 4114 taxus baccata; ‘the oldest tree’ might be a better instant solution).\nThe code is also used as a visual element to depict taxus crown/needles structure. \nAnother, more obvious ‘code’ is the shape of ‘4’ ( 4 millenniums).\nsize: approximately 16 x 10 x 7cm (18x12x10 box)\nmaterials - base: wood, dark varnish\n\ttop part: aluminium or similar light metal (3mm thick) or\n\tplastic (3-5mm), preferably slightly translucent to give more depth; or\n\tplywood/veneer (more demanding production)\nMinimal shape intervention transforms the tree contour into a phone stand. \nColour scheme: very dark unpolished base – age, strength, nature; colder, unsaturated green was chosen to fit most current interiors. The same design works with other greens equally well. I’d recommend to keep the dark base solution and use grainy pieces of wood. Several tiny berries (paint) on the inner side are optional.\nBackground: FUNCTIONAL ITEM as a souvenir has a longer ‘active life’ and impacts more people during use (compared to sitting on a shelf). When given as a gift it has much more chance to be kept or (worst case scenario) forwarded to someone who will actively use it.\nTarget audience: everyone (you can hardly find a person without a phone. It fits an office desk as well as a night table,.. Also works as a stand-alone decoration)  \nPlease let me know if you’re interested in this approach in general or its particular elements.

I am a designer and a fan of the construction of wooden objects. The project that I propose to you is a prototype that I already carry out in an opportunity as part of my personal works. I saw the publication of his project and immediately thought about the work he had done. I made some small modifications to adapt it to your requirement and modify the 3d sketch a bit. The result is that I present my description to you to evaluate it.\n\nI emphasize that I already made one and I can give support as it is in images, only that it does not have the foliage because I designed it to place telephones and personal cards, however it was very easy to do it and it is very nice. I think adding the piece of acrylic, the stamp engraved on fire and maybe playing with the wood inks will be much better. If you consider my proposal as the winner I will be on this side offering the support you need to achieve the desired design.\n\nGreetings and happy night.","score":3,"is_entirely_original":true,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/c0/47308957be5c417c9d891d4cb1d2c883.jpg"],"revision_number":10,"height":2401,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/83/e6ddd2a2d0f54bc4b09fef15009c052e"}],"award_value":null,"entry_created_at":"2018-04-07T00:29:49.675948+00:00","updated_at":"2018-04-26T00:15:37.933764+00:00","withdrawn":true,"tip_value":0.0,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"project":2897161,"entry_number":10,"author":3060215,"finalist":false,"winner":false,"eliminated":false,"entry_feedback":{"color":true,"composition":true},"author_username":"sherandu","entry_type":"image","offer_value":0.0}]}
