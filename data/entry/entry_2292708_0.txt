Here is a composition of matching letterhead and one sided business card. I wanted to try adding a red bar at the bottom so that it would stay consistent with the red in your signs. I like this composition a lot and I think it ties your overall brand very nicely. We can however, play with alternate compositions without the bar if you'd like. We can also put your logo on the back of the card if you so desire to make it a 2 sided card. I will upload a version without the bar also so you can see both in the gallery. \r\n\r\nThese designs can still be tweaked... please let me know if you have ideas after seeing this first draft. I encourage collaboration!!!! \r\n\r\nTalk with you soon. \r\n\r\nPS... I have added Fax and Mobile number... we can omit unnecessary lines and info. I am unfamiliar with the phone numbers and uses of commas in the address used in Europe so if I did not lay it out correctly I apologize. With your guidance we can nail this design during the contest or after I am awarded. I am online pretty much all day so if you reply today I can revise ASAP.

First of all... Thank you so much for the great and detailed feedback. You dont know how much it helps us when a client is as active as you are and offers new direction and ideas. Many, if not all of my awarded designs have come through a careful collaboration between the client and myself. All of my designs are displayed proudly under my profile, and I hope to add yours to it very soon.\r\n\r\nHere are some new revisions for you to consider. I have taken Requiem and combined it with Gotham, another Hoefler-Frere Jones font that is absolutely gorgeous. This is generally my go-to font.. it is used by many, many high profile brands in the world today. I have given some options using the weight \"Book\"; not too thin, but not too thick either. Also, both caps and non cap variations. I have all the weights on this font including condensed versions if you would like to try another one out.\r\n\r\nI have also taken the image from Signworld and displayed it as a possible composition. The only thing I would say about a vertical composition with the sign that you should consider is the length of your name. As you can see, the word Henson's fits nicely in there because it is a much shorter word. Your name is a little longer so it takes away letter size pretty drastically. Other than that, I think the signs will look fantastic and you have a good eye (even though you claim you dont for design :)\r\n\r\nTake a look at these new uploads, absorb them, reflect a bit on them and get back to me. I am tenacious when I am in the running for a contest and I assure you I reply fast and provide honest feedback and great customer service.\r\n\r\nPlease, if you have more suggestions, dont hesitate to ask. If I can upload another variation I will certainly do so. Have a great weekend and I look forward to making this design the best it can.\r\n\r\nCibi","thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/c4/d87666b14fd14db9844b370c4ca014e4.jpg"],"new":false,"score":5,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/00/dae1fb72854c4ebea338c3ad053a649a.jpg","width":3333,"entry":3361582,"additional_costs":{},"height":3333,"is_entirely_original":false,"id":3361582,"created_at":"2011-02-26T17:31:52+00:00","revision_number":62}],"withdrawn":false},{"award_value":null,"finalist":false,"tip_value":0.0,"entry_created_at":"2011-02-26T15:11:57+00:00","offer_value":0.0,"updated_at":"2011-03-02T14:33:33+00:00","project":2292708,"winner":false,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"author":2301015,"entry_number":61,"eliminated":false,"author_username":"GraySource","entry_type":"image","entry_feedback":{},"id":3361278,"revisions":[{"description":"What if as simple as this...","thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/54/c5e3ad3d32874706879ffbab49026696.jpg"],"new":false,"score":2,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/b3/7c097acf045841d9938884b80961cfe5.png","width":950,"entry":3361278,"additional_costs":{},"height":950,"is_entirely_original":true,"id":3361278,"created_at":"2011-02-26T15:11:57+00:00","revision_number":61}],"withdrawn":false},{"award_value":null,"finalist":false,"tip_value":0.0,"entry_created_at":"2011-02-26T07:29:34+00:00","offer_value":0.0,"updated_at":"2011-02-26T14:06:08+00:00","project":2292708,"winner":false,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"author":2335908,"entry_number":60,"eliminated":false,"author_username":"SAVAGEDESIGN","entry_type":"image","entry_feedback":{},"id":3360575,"revisions":[{"description":"My idea for this is to just visualize the sign how it looks like.
