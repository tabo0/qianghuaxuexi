The PSD file format is an industry standard and it allows color\nchanges, or even adding or removing parts of the logo (by hiding or activating layers). The normal desktop printers (ink-jet and\ncolour photocopier) are designed to work happily with a range of image file formats, including JPEG compressed files. However they\nwill still work best with the maximum amount of image data supplied by an uncompressed image such as a PSD file.\n\nEPS: This is an industry standard, meaning \"Encapsulated PostScript\". It can be imported into all major design programs, and is often\nthe file of choice for printing companies.\n\nPDF: Portable Document Format (PDF) is a file format used to represent documents in a manner independent of application software, hardware, and operating systems.Each PDF file encapsulates a complete description of a fixed-layout flat document, including the text, fonts, graphics, and other information needed to display it. \n\nFont: This is a standart font, a copy will be included with the final deliverables.\n\nAlso i will include PNG transparent background and JPEG highres 4000x4000 pixel 300 dpi for web.\n\nPlease tell me if you need any change in my designs !\nI will fix it as soon as you reply this messege.\n\nBest,\nAvartde","height":1200,"width":1200,"id":9881618,"additional_costs":{"fonts":"","images":""},"entry":9885236,"revision_number":15,"is_entirely_original":true,"created_at":"2017-09-27T01:46:11.825319+00:00","score":4,"thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/01/815f4f74f481405694ef002b7d0698f0.jpg"]}],"entry_created_at":"2017-09-27T01:46:07.750060+00:00","offer_value":0.0,"award_value":null,"project":2891036,"entry_feedback":{"feedback":"I added a comment but in case that dosen't get to you.
