Anywayz after the last detailed brief i have come up with a design. Instead of the circles or rectangles, I've created a file icon with will be representing each files. the blue is the normal state file and the red with the error files. Also on mouse over (hover) the files will be displaying the file name as well as the file size. I have provided 2 options in case the option 1 doesn't work out well. I hope i've understood your requirement well. If not plz suggest me if I'm not in the right track. I'm working on the screen 2 and will be submitting as soon as it's done.\r\n\r\nThank you","thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/ab/8980595c1bb94e4e87a2c52b418c4dd1.jpg"],"new":false,"score":3,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/e7/fed3cc691a234602be4dc96bb002ace9.jpg","width":640,"entry":6154097,"additional_costs":{},"height":480,"is_entirely_original":false,"id":6154097,"created_at":"2013-09-01T05:58:23+00:00","revision_number":7}],"withdrawn":true},{"award_value":null,"finalist":false,"tip_value":0.0,"entry_created_at":"2013-08-31T23:38:45+00:00","offer_value":0.0,"updated_at":"2013-09-15T12:37:35+00:00","project":2358237,"winner":false,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"author":546609,"entry_number":6,"eliminated":false,"author_username":"designingzone","entry_type":"image","entry_feedback":{},"id":6153787,"revisions":[{"description":"Here is the actual design without text so you can see how the circles and squares will going to look on your web page.\r\nFeedback appreciated.\r\nThanks","thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/27/60f59e17366a4a5f8bcb82a7a4ed2772.jpg"],"new":false,"score":3,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/ab/d530955a628d4397a1665ca617f95c29.jpg","width":1200,"entry":6153787,"additional_costs":{},"height":1400,"is_entirely_original":true,"id":6153787,"created_at":"2013-08-31T23:38:45+00:00","revision_number":6}],"withdrawn":true},{"award_value":null,"finalist":false,"tip_value":0.0,"entry_created_at":"2013-08-31T23:36:59+00:00","offer_value":0.0,"updated_at":"2013-09-15T12:37:53+00:00","project":2358237,"winner":false,"withdrawn_by_admin":false,"author":546609,"entry_number":5,"eliminated":false,"author_username":"designingzone","entry_type":"image","entry_feedback":{},"id":6153785,"revisions":[{"description":"Hi.. here is my design.. in which I also shown what the purpose of the circle and squares. and in the next entry I will upload same design with text so you can how the actual design will going to look.\r\nFeedback appreciated.\r\nThanks","thumbnails":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/fb/93c016e799c44dd9b7f710c94861e8e2.jpg"],"new":false,"score":3,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdspring3-production/project_entries/2e/22a6de320578452a9c199508ac236d29.jpg","width":1200,"entry":6153785,"additional_costs":{},"height":1400,"is_entirely_original":true,"id":6153785,"created_at":"2013-08-31T23:36:59+00:00","revision_number":5}],"withdrawn":true}]}
