Sorry to keep you waiting. I made an alternative to the design that you suggested yesterday.\n\n1. This design, I gave a connecting bar in the middle to hold the bottom bar. In my opinion this is better and stronger considering to the up and down movement of the user. When it comes up, the pad holds back surfaces against the wall, when it comes down, then it is held by the top door frame.\n\n2. This is the design you described yesterday. But with a wide pad, for a good friction surface. The disadvantage is to shift very much, and make the wall blister.\n\n3. This is the same design as before. But using a different simulation method, so it can be seen the color gradation.\n\n4. This is the same design, like no 3. But it's just an idea to compare it. Here the bottom bar is locked, can use bolts. There is no friction on the wall but the load will be centered.\n\nWhy am I concerned about the friction on the wall and putting aside the hook crossing the door frame? Because premium pull up bar ikonfitness has a bad reputation with users for those 2 problems.
